# A Good Man Is Hard To Find

A good man is hard to find
Only strangers sleep in my bed
My favorite words are good-bye
And my favorite color is red
I always play Russian Roulette in my head
It's seventeen black and twenty-nine red
How far from the gutter; how far from the pew
I'll always remember to forget about you
A good man is hard to find
Only strangers sleep in my bed
My favorite words are good-bye
And my favorite color is red
A long dead soldier looks out from the frame
No one remembers his war; no one
remembers his name
Go out to the meadow; scare off all the crows
It does nothing but rain here, and nothing 
will grow
A good man is hard to find
Only strangers sleep in my bed
My favorite words are good-bye
And my favorite color is red

# A Little Rain

The Ice Man's mule is parked 
Outside the bar
Where a man with missing fingers
Plays a strange guitar
And the German dwarf
Dances with the butcher's son
And a little rain never hurt noone
And a little rain never hurt noone
They're dancing on the roof
And the ceiling's coming down
I sleep with my shovel and my leather gloves
A little trouble makes it worth the going
And a little rain never hurt noone
The world is round
And so I'll go around
You must risk something that matters
My hands are strong
I'll take any man here
If it's worth the going
It's worth the ride
She was 15 years old
And never seen the ocean
She climbed into a van
With a vagabond
And the last thing she said
Was "I love you mom"
And a little rain 
Never hurt noone
And a little rain 
Never hurt noone

# A Sight For Sore Eyes

A sight for sore eyes it's a long time no see
Working hard hardly working hey man you know me
Water under the bridge did you see my new car
Well it's bought and it's paid for parked outside of the bar
And hey barkeep what's keeping you keep pouring drinks
For all these palookas hey you know what I thinks
That we toast to the old days and DiMaggio too
And old Drysdale and Mantle Whitey Ford and to you
Oh you know the old gang ain't around everyone has left town
Except for Thumm and Giardina said they just might be down
Oh half drunk all the time and I'm all drunk the rest
Yeah Monk's still the champion oh but I am the best
And hey barkeep what's keeping you keep pouring drinks
For all these palookas hey you know what I thinks
That we toast to the old days and DiMaggio too
And old Drysdale and Mantle Whitey Ford and to you
Guess you heard about Nash he was killed in a crash
Oh that must have been two or three years ago now
Yeah he spun out and he rolled he hit a telephone pole
And he died with the radio on
No she's married with a kid finally split up with Sid
He's up north for a nickel's worth for armed robbery
And I'll play you some pinball no you ain't got a chance
Then go on over and ask her to dance
And hey barkeep what's keeping you keep pouring drinks
For all these palookas hey you know what I thinks
That we toast to the old days and DiMaggio too
And Drysdale and Mantle Whitey Ford and to you

# A Sweet Little Bullet from a Pretty Blue Gun

Well it's raining it's pouring
you didn't bring a sweater
Nebraska will never let you come back home
Now on Hollywood and Vine
by the Thrifty Mart sign
any night I'll be willin to bet
there's a young girl
with sweet little dreams and pretty blue wishes
standin there just gettin all wet
Now there's a place off the drag
called the Gilbert Hotel
and there's a couple letters
burned out in the sign
and it's better than a bus stop
they do good business every time it rains
for little girls with nothing in their jeans
but pretty blue wishes and sweet little dreams
and its raining its pouring
the old man is snoring
now I lay me down to sleep
I hear the sirens in the street
all my dreams are made of chrome
I have no way to get back home
I'd rather die before I wake
like Marilyn Monroe(7)
and you could throw my dreams out in the street
and let the rain make 'em grow
now the night clerk he got a club foot
he's heard every hard luck story
at least a hundred times or more
he says check out time is 10 am
and thats just what it means
go on up the stairs
with sweet little wishes and pretty blue dreams
and it's raining its pouring
and Hollywood's just fine
swindle a little girl out of her dreams
another letter in the sign
now never trust a scarecrow wearin shades after dark
be careful of that old bow tie he wears
it takes a sweet little bullet from a pretty blue gun
to put those scarlet ribbons in your hair
no that ain't no cherry bomb
fourth of July's all done
just some fool playin that second line
from the barrel of a pretty blue gun
o that ain't no cherry bomb
fourth of July's all done
just some fool playin that second line
from the barrel of a pretty blue gun

# Alice

It's dreamy weather we're on
You wave your crooked wand
Along an icy pond
With a frozen moon
A murder of silhouette crows I saw...
And the tears on my face
And the skates on the pond they spell Alice
I'll disappear in your name
But you must wait for me
Somewhere beneath the sea
There's the wreck of a ship
Your hair is like meadow grass
On the tide And the raindrops on my window
And the ice in my drink
Baby, all that I can think of Is Alice
Arithmetic Arithmetock I turn the hands back on the clock
How does the ocean rock the boat
How did the razor find my throat
The only strings that hold me here
Are tangled up around the pier
And so a secret kiss
Brings madness with the bliss
And I will think of this
When I'm dead in my grave
Set me adrift and I'm lost over there
But I must be insane
To go skating on your name
And by tracing it twice
I fell through the ice Of Alice
There's only Alice

# All Stripped Down

Well the time will come
When the wind will shout
All stripped down 
All stripped down
And all the sinners know
What I'm talking about
All stripped down 
All stripped down
When all the creatures of the world
Are gonna line up at the gate
All stripped down All stripped down
And you better be on time
And you better not be late
All stripped 
All stripped down
Well, you know in your heart
What you gotta bring
All stripped down
All stripped down
No big mink coat
No diamond ring
All stripped down 
All stripped down
Well take off your paint
And take off your rouge
All stripped down 
All stripped down
Let your backbone flip
And let your spirit shine thru
I want you all stripped
All stripped
All stripped down
All the men we got
Well they're goin' down the drain
All stripped down 
All stripped down
And when I see your sadness
On a river of shame
All stripped down 
All stripped down
You got to raise up
Both the quick and the dead
All stripped down 
All stripped down
With no shoes on your feet
No hat on your head
I want you all stripped 
All stripped 
All stripped down
Ain't nothin' in my heart
But fire for you
All stripped down 
All stripped down
With my rainy hammer
And a heart that's true
All stripped 
All stripped down

#All The World Is Green

I fell into the ocean
When you became my wife
I risked it all against the sea
To have a better life
Marie you're the wild blue sky
And men do foolish things
You turn kings into beggars
And beggars into kings
Pretend that you owe me nothing
And all the world is green
We can bring back the old
days again
And all the world is green
The face forgives the mirror
The worm forgives the plow
The questions begs the answer
Can you forgive me somehow
Maybe when our story's over
We'll go where it's always spring
The band is playing our song again
And all the world is green
Pretend that you owe me nothing
And all the world is green
We can bring back the old
days again
And all the world is green
The moon is yellow silver
Oh the things that summer brings
It's a love you'd kill for
And all the world is green
He is balancing a diamond
On a blade of grass
The dew will settle on our grave
When all the world is green

# Altar Boy

He's an ol' altar boy
lying out there in the street
he's an ol' altar boy
bound up in leather and chains
that's why I'm feeling so blue
I'm an old altar boy
what about you
now I can order in Latin
make 'em au gratin Joe
I'm an old altar boy
that's why I'm so depressed
I never got the rest of the dream
just the ritual
now I'm habitual
majoring in crimes 
that are unspeakable
cause I'm an old altar boy
that's what happened to me
I'm an old altar boy
he's hoping he can meet a woman 
dressed like a nun
he knows there's got to be some around here
drinking across from the church
a little Father Cribari wine
on a Sunday morn' time
I'm an old altar boy
why is he winking at this time in his life
he never took a wife 
cause he's an old altar boy
oh yeah
what about you

# Another Man's Vine

Another Man's Vine
Bougainvillea's bloom and wind
Be careful mind the strangle vines
The rose is climbing over blind
Ã«Cause the sun is on the other side
The bees will find their honey
The sweetest every time
Around a Red Rose
I see a red rose, a red rose
Blooming on another man's vine
Golden Willie's gone to war
He left his young wife on the shore
Will she be steadfast everyday?
While Golden Willie is far away
Along the way her letters end
She never reads what Willie sends
Now I see a red rose
I smell a red rose
A red rose
Blooming on another man's vine

# Around a Red Rose

I see a red rose, a red rose
Blooming on another man's vine
Golden Willie's gone to war
He left his young wife on the shore
Will she be steadfast everyday?
While Golden Willie is far away
Along the way her letters end
She never reads what Willie sends
Now I see a red rose
I smell a red rose
A red rose
Blooming on another man's vine
Anywhere I Lay My Head
My head is spinning round
My heart is in my shoes
I went and set the Thames on fire
Now I must come back down
She's laughing in her sleeve at me
I can feel it in my bones
But anywhere I'm gonna 
Lay my head, boys
I'm will call my home
Well I see that 
The world is upside down
My pockets were filled up with gold
Now the clouds have covered o'er
And the wind is blowing cold
I don't need anybody
Because I learned to be alone
And anywhere 
I lay my head, boys
I will call my home

# Army Ants

The whirligig beetles are wary and fast 
with an organ to detect the ripples
the arachnid moths lay their eggs inside 
other insects along the borders of fields or roads 
in clusters of white cocoons
the ribbed pine borer is a longhorn beetle 
their antenna's are half the length of their body 
and they feed on dead red pine
robber flies with their immobile heads
inject a paralyzing fluid into their prey 
that they snatch from life in mid-air
the snow flea's mode of locomotion
strange and odd 
with a spiny tail mechanism with hooks 
and a protracted tube from the abdomen 
to enable moisture absorption
the female praying mantis devours the male 
while they are mating 
the male sometimes continues copulating 
even after the female has bitten off his head 
and part of his upper torso
every night wasps bite into the stem of a plant
lock their mandibles into position
stretch out at right angles to the stem and
with legs dangling they fall asleep
if one places a minute amount of liquor 
on a scorpion
it will instantly go mad and 
sting itself to death
the bombardier beetle 
when disturbed 
defends itself by emitting a series of explosions
sometimes setting off four or five reports in succession
the noises sound like miniature popgun blasts 
and are accompanied by a cloud of 
reddish coloured vile smelling fluid
it is commonly known that ants keep slaves
certain species 
the so-called sanguinary ants 
in particular
will raid the nests of other ant tribes 
and kill the queen and then kidnap many of the workers
the workers are brought back to the captor's hive 
where they are coerced into performing menial tasks
and as we discussed last semester 
the army ants will leave nothing but your bones
perhaps you've encountered some of these insects 
in your communities 
displaying both their predatory and defense characteristics
while embedded within the walls of flesh 
and passing for what is most commonly recognized
as human

# Baby Gonna Leave Me

Well I stood on the corner
Til my feet got wet
I stood by the faucet
Till the sink filled up
I stood by the window
Till the moon came up
My baby bought a ticket
Long as my clothes line
Na na na na na
My baby went and left me
In a '49 Ford
Going down the highway in a
49 sword
my baby ripped my heart out
with every turn of the moon
somebody told me there's
never been a rose without a thorn
na na na na na na
na na na na na na
And if I was a tree
I'd be a cut down tree
And if I was a bed 
I'd be an unmade bed
I'll get my 32/20 and it'll
Have to do
Na na na na na na
Gone like the wind in 
The meadow
And the rain on the hill
You even left your lipstick
And your powder and your blush
Baby gonna leave me
On a Grey Hound Bus
The stars are melting
All across the sky
Na na na na na 
I let the dog out
But he didn't come back
Stood on the corner till
My feet got wet
Baby gonna leave me in a 49 Ford
I stood by the window
Till the moon came up
Na na na na na 
Na na na na na

#Back In The Crowd

If you donât want these arms to hold you
If you donât want these lips to kiss you
If youâve found somebody new
Put me back in the crowd
Put the sun behind the clouds
Put me back in the crowd
Thereâs a battle going on
Between the blue and the grey
And if you donât want my love
Donât make me stay
Take back your name
Take back these wings
Take my picture from the frame
And put me back in the crowd
Put the sun behind the cloud
Put me back in the crowd
Put me back in the crowd
Put the sun behind the cloud
Put me back in the crowd

#Back In The Good Old World

When I was a boy, 
the moon was a pearl
the sun a yellow gold.
But when I was a man, 
the wind blew cold
the hills were upside down.
But now that I have gone from here
there's no place I'd rather be
than to float my chances on the tide
Back in the good old world
On October's last I'll fly back home
rolling down winding way.
Scare crows are all dressed in rags
out at the edge of the field I lay
and all I've got's a pocket full
of flowers on my grave.
Oh but summer is gone 
I remember it best
Back in the good old world

# Bad As Me

Youâre the head on the spear
Youâre the nail on the cross
Youâre the fly in my beer
Youâre the key that got lost
Youâre the letter from Jesus on the bathroom wall
Youâre mother superior in only a bra
Youâre the same kind of bad as me
Iâm the hat on the bed
Iâm the coffee instead
The fish or cut bait
Iâm the detective up late
Iâm the blood on the floor
The thunder and the roar
The boat that wonât sink
I just wonât sleep a wink
Youâre the same kind of bad as me
No good you say
Well thatâs good enough for me
Youâre the wreath that caught fire
Youâre the preach to the choir
You bite down on the sheet
But your teeth have been wired
You skid in the rain
Youâre trying to shift
Youâre grinding the gears
Youâre trying to shift
And youâre the same kind of bad as me
They told me you were no good
I know youâll take care of all my needs
Youâre the same kind of bad as me
Iâm the mattress in the back
Iâm the old gunnysack
Iâm the one with the gun
Most likely to run
Iâm the car in the weeds
If you cut me Iâll bleed
Youâre the same kind of bad as me
Youâre the same kind of bad as me

# Bad Liver And A Broken Heart

Well I got a bad liver and a broken heart
yea I drunk me a river since you tore me apart
and I don't have a drinking problem 
cept when I can't get a drink
and I wish you'd a known her 
we were quite a pair
she was sharp as a razor 
and soft as a prayer
so welcome to the continuing saga
she was my better half 
and I was just a dog
and so here am I slumped
I been chippied and I been chumped 
on my stool
so buy this fool, some spirits and libations
it's these railroad station bars
with all these conductors and the porters
and I'm all out of quarters
and this epitaph is the aftermath
yea I choose my path 
hey come on Cath, he's a lawyer 
he ain't the one for ya
and no the moon ain't romantic 
it's intimidating as hell
and some guy's tryin to sell 
me a watch
and so I'll meet you at the 
bottom of a bottle of 
bargain scotch
I got me a bottle and a dream
it's so maudlin it seems
you can name your poison
go on ahead and make some noise 
I ain't sentimental
this ain't a purchase it's a rental 
and it's purgatory, hey 
what's your story, well 
I don't even care
cause I got my own double-cross to bear
and I'll see your Red Label 
and I'll raise you one more
and you can pour me a cab 
I just can't drink no more
cause it don't douse the flames
that are started by dames 
it ain't like asbestos
it don't do nothing but 
rest us assured
and substantiate the rumors 
that you've heard

# Barber Shop

Good morning mister snip snip snip
With your hair cut just as short as mine
Good morning mister snip snip snip
With your hair cut just as short as mine
Bay rum lucky tiger butch wax cracker jacks
Shoe shine jaw breaker magazine racks
Hanging round the barber shop a side-burning close crop
Morning Mr. Furgeson what's the good word with you
Staying out of trouble like a good boy should
I see you're still cutting hair I'm still cutting classes
I got a couple passes to the ringle bros barn bail circus afternoon
You lost a little round the middle and you're looking real good
Sitting on the wagon instead of under the hood
What's the low-down Mr. Brown I heard your boy's leaving town
I bought myself a struggle buggy sucker's powder blue
Throw me over the sports page Cincinnati looking good
I always been for Pittsburgh and I lay you 10 to 1
The Pirates get the pennant and the series before their done
The hair's getting longer you know the skirts are getting shorter
And don't you know that you can get a cheaper haircut 
If you wanna cross the border
If your mama saw you smoking well she'd kick your ass
Now you put it out you juvenile and put it out fast
Well if I had a million dollars what would I do
I'd probably be a barber not a bum like you
Still got your paper route now that's just fine
And you can pay me double because you gypped me last time
And don't you know that you can keep a little circus money 
And spend it on a girl
And just remember that I give the best haircuts 
In the whole wide world
I give the best haircuts in the whole wide world
Good morning mister snip snip snip
With your hair cut just as short as mine
Good morning mister snip snip snip
With your hair cut just as short as mine

# Barcarolle

A cloud lets go of the moon
Her ribbons are all out of tune
She's skating on the ice in a glass
And in the hands of a man
That she kissed on a train
The children have all gone into town
To get candy and we are
Alone in the house here
And your eyes fall down on me
And I belong only to you
The water is filling my shoes
In the wine of my heart there's a stone
In a well made of bone I will bring to the pond
And she's here in your pocket
And curled up in a dollar
And the chain from your watch
Around her neck
And I'll stay right here till it's time
The girls all knit in the shade
Before the baby is made
The branches bend down to the ground
Here to swing on
And I'm lost in the blond summer grass
And the train whistle blows
And the carnival goes
Till there's only the tickets and crows
But the grass will all grow back
And the branches Spell Alice
And I belong to you

# Bend Down The Branches

The sky is as deep as it can be
bend down the branches
close your eyes and you will see
bend down the branches
you're like a willow
once you were gold
we're made for bending
even beauty gets old
climb the stairs they're not so steep
bend down the branches
close your eyes and go to sleep
bend down the branches

# Better Off Without A Wife

All my friends are married
Every Tom and Dick and Harry
You must be strong if you're to go it alone
Here's to the bachelors and the Bowery bums
Those who feel that they're the ones
That are better off without a wife
Cause I like to sleep until the crack of noon
Midnight howling at the moon
Going out when I want to,
And I'm coming home when I please
Don't have to ask permission
If I wanna go out fishing
Never have to ask for the keys
I've never been no Valentino
But I had a girl who lived in Reno
Left me for a trumpet player
Well, it didn't get me down
He was wanted for assault
And though he said it weren't his fault
You know the coppers rode him right out of town
I'll be sleeping until the crack of noon
Midnight howling at the moon
And I'll be going out when I want to
Coming home when I please
Don't have to ask permission
If I wanna go out fishing
Never have to ask for the keys
Yeah, you see I'm kinda selfish about my privacy
Now as long as I can be with me
We get along so well I can't even believe it
I love to chew the fat with folks
I'll be listening to all your dirty jokes
I'm so thankful for these friends I do receive
I'll be sleeping until the crack of noon
Midnight howling at the moon
And I'll be going out when I want to
Coming home when I please
Don't have to ask permission
If I wanna go out fishing
Never have to ask for the keys, no
Hey, I got this girl I know, man, and I just
She's been married several times and
I don't wanna end up like her
I mean, she's been married so many times
She's got rice-marks all over her face
Yeah, you know the kind

# Big Black Mariah

Big Black Mariah
Cuttin' through the cane break 
Rattling the sill
Thunder that the rain makes 
When the shadow tops the hill
Big light on the back street 
Hill to Evermore. Packin' down the ladder 
With the hammer to the floor
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Ford
Well he's all boxed up 
On a red bell dame
Hunted Black Johnny with 
A blind man's cane
A yellow bullet with a 
Rag out in the wind
An old blind tiger 
Get an old bell Jim
Here comes the Big Black 
Mariah. Here comes the Big Black 
Mariah. Here comes the Big Black 
Mariah. Here comes the Big Black Ford
Sent to the skies on a 
Benny Jag Blue
Off to bed without his supper 
Like the Linda brides do
Now he's got to do the story 
With the old widow Jones...
He's got a wooden coat this boy 
Is never coming home
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Ford
Cut through the 
Cane break...
Well he's all boxed up 
On a red bell dame
Hunted Black Johnny with 
A blind man's cane
A yellow bullet with a 
Rag out in the wind
An old blind tiger 
Get an old bell Jim
Here comes the Big Black 
Mariah. Here comes the Big Black 
Mariah. Here comes the Big Black 
Mariah. Here comes the Big Black Ford

# Big Joe And Phantom 309

See, I just happened to be back on the East coast a few years back
I was trying to make me a buck like everybody else
I'll be damned if times didn't get hard, and Christ I got down on my luck
And I got tired of just roaming and bumming around
So I started thumbing my way back to my old hometown
And you know, I made quite a few miles in the first couple of days
You know, I figured I'd be home in a week if my luck held out this way
You know, it was the third night, oh and I got stranded
And it was out at a cold lonely crossroads
And as the rain came pouring down, man I was hungry
Yeah, I was hungry, tired and freezing, caught myself a chill
But it was just about that time
Yeah, it was just about that time that the lights of an old semi topped the hill
You should've seen me smile when I heard them air brakes come on
Yeah, and I climbed up into that cab where I knew it'd be warm
At the wheel... well, at the wheel sat a big man
And I'd have to say he must've weighed two ten
As he stuck out a big hand and he said with a grin
'Big Joe's the name, and this here rig is called Phantom 309'
Well, I asked him why he called his rig such a name
And you know, he turned to me and said 
'Why son, don't you know this here rig'll be putting 'em all to shame
Nah, there ain't a driver
No, there ain't a driver on this or any other line for that matter that
That's seen nothing but the taillights of Big Joe and Phantom 309'
So we rode and we talked the better part of the night
And I told my stories and Joe told his
And I smoked up all his Viceroys as we rolled along
Pushed her ahead with ten forward gears
Man, that dashboard was lit like the old Madame La Rue pinball
Serious semi-truck
'Til almost mysteriously
Well, it was the lights of a truck stop that rolled into sight
Joe turned to me, said 'I'm sorry son, but I'm afraid this is just as far as you go, you see
You see, I kinda gotta be making a turn just up the road a piece'
I'll be damned if he didn't toss me a dime as he threw her in low and said
'Go on in there son, and get yourself a hot cup of coffee on Big Joe'
I mean to tell you, when Joe and his rig pulled off into the night
Man, in nothing flat they was clean outta sight
So I walked into this stop, well I ordered me up a cup of mud
Saying 'Big Joe's setting this dude up'
But it got so deadly quiet in that place
Yeah, it got so deadly quiet in that place, you could've heard a pin drop
And as the waiter's face turned kind of pale I said
'What's the matter, did I say something wrong?'
I kind of said with a half way grin
He said, 'No son, you see it'll kinda happen every now and then
'Cause every driver in here knows Big Joe, son, but
But let me tell you what happened just ten years ago out there
Yeah, it was years ago, out there at that cold lonely crossroads
And there was a whole busload of kids
And then they were just coming from school
And they were right in the middle when Joe topped the hill and
They could've been slaughtered except Joe turned his wheels
And he jackknifed, yeah he jackknifed, and he went into a skid
And you know, folks around here, well
They say he gave his life to save that bunch of kids
And out there at that cold lonely crossroads
Well, they're saying it was the end of the line for Big Joe and Phantom 309
But it's funny you know, cause... cause every now and then
Yeah, every now and then when the moon's holding water
Well, they say that old Joe'll stop and give you a ride
It seems, just like you, some hitchhiker will be coming by'
'So here, son,' he said to me, 'you get yourself another cup of coffee
It's on the house, I kind of want you to hang on to that dime
Yeah, I kind of want you to hang on to that dime as a souvenir
I want you to keep that dime as a souvenir of Big Joe
Of Big Joe and Phantom
Big Joe and Phantom 309'

# Black Market Baby

She lives in a house
that's way back off the road
There's a man with a lantern
and he carries her soul
A coal stove and a bed
A skillet and a hound
She drove a camel through
A needle
In this sinking board walk town
She's my Black Market baby
She's my Black Market baby
She's a diamond that
wants to stay coal
wants to stay coal
I swang out wide with her
on hells iron gate
Anything that you wanted 
you could have
My eyes say their prayers to her
sailors ring her bell
Like a moth mistakes a light bulb
For the moon and goes to hell
She's my Black Market baby
She's my Black Market baby
She's a diamond that
wants to stay coal
wants to stay coal
There's no prayer like desire
There's amnesia in her kiss
She's a swan and a pistol
and she will follow you like this
In Moberly, Missouri at the
Iroquois Hotel 
She checked in with the President
and she ran up quite a Bill
(Chorus)
She's whiskey in a teacup
She gives blondes a lousy name
She's a Bonzai Aphrodite
and a ticket back to Spain
She's a hard way to go
and there ain't no way
to stop
Every time you play the red
the black is coming up
She's my Black Market baby
She's my Black Market baby
She's a diamond that
Wants to stay coal
Wants to stay coal

#The Black Rider

Come on along with the Black Rider
We'll have a gay old time
Lay down in the web of the black spider
I'll drink your blood like wine
So come on in
it ain't no sin
take off your skin
and dance around in your bones
So come on along with the Black Rider
We'll have a gay old time
Anchors away with the Black Rider
I'll drink your blood like wine
I'll drop you off in Harlem with the Black Rider
Out where the bullets shine
And when you're done
you cock your gun
the blood will run
like ribbons through your hair
So come on along with the Black Rider
We'll have a gay old time
Come on along with the Black Rider
I've got just the thing for thee
Come on along with the Black Rider
I want your company
I'll have the veal
a lovely meal
that's how I feel
May I use your skull for a bowl
Come on along with the Black Rider
We'll have a gay old time

# Black Wings

Take an eye for an eye
Take a tooth for a tooth
Just like they say in the Bible
Never leave a trace or forget a face
Of any man at the table
Any man at the table
When the moon is a cold chiseled dagger
Sharp enough to draw blood from a stone
He rides through your dreams on a coach 
And horses and the fence posts 
In the moonlight look like bones.
Well they've stopped trying to hold him
With mortar, stone and chain
He broke out of every prison
Boots mount the staircase
The door is flung back open
He's not there for he has risen,
He's not there for he has risen
Well he once killed a man with a guitar string
He's been seen at the table with kings
Well he once saved a baby from drowning
There are those that say beneath his coat there are wings
Some say they fear him
Others admire him
Because he steals his promise
One look in his eye
Everyone denies
Ever having met him
Ever having met him
He can turn himself into a stranger
Well they broke a lot of canes on his hide
He was born away in a cornfield
A fever beats in his head like a drum inside
Some say they fear him
Others admire him
Because he steals his promise
One look in his eye
Everyone denies
Ever having met him
Ever having met him

# Blind Love

Now you're gone
And it's hotels and whiskey and sad luck dames
and I don't care if they miss me
and I never remember their names
they say if you get far enough away
you'll be on your way back home
well I'm at the station
and I can't get on the train
it must be blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
Blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
With your blind love
With your blind love
Stone blind love
With your blind love
Now the streets are turning blue
and the dogs are barking 
and the night has come
and there are tears that are falling
from your blue eyes now
Well I wonder where you are
and I whisper your name
The only way to find you
is if I close my eyes
I'll find you with my blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
It's your blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
Stone blind love
Only kind of love is stone blind love
With your blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
Stone blind love
Stone blind love
Oh it's blind love
Blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
With your blind love
Oh it's blind love
Blind love
With your stone blind love

# Blow Wind Blow

Mary's on the black top
There's a husband in 
the dog house
In the middle of a shakedown
She got 
quiet as a church mouse
She found Raleigh's on 
the dashboard
Sugar daddy caught a polocar
Ain't no solitary 
tap dance way down here
I swear I's ridin
on a field mouse
we were dancin' in the slaughterhouse
If you swing along the beltway
then you skid along the all day
cause I went a little crazy
and I sat upon a high chair
And I'm smokin like a diesel
way out here
Blow wind blow- blow me away here-
blow wind blow (repeat)

# Blue Valentines

She sends me blue valentines all the way from Philadelphia
to mark the anniversary of someone that I used to be
And it feels like a warrant is out for my arrest
baby you got me checkin in my rearview mirror
thats why I'm always on the run it's why I changed my name
and I didn't think you'd ever find me here
to send me blue valentines like half forgotten dreams
like a pebble in my shoe as I walk these streets
and the ghost of your memory baby its the thistle in the kiss
its the burglar that can break a rose's neck
its the tatooed broken promise I gotta hide beneath my sleeve
I'm gonna see you every time I turn my back
oh you send me blue valentines though I try to remain at large
they're insisting that our love must have a eulogy
why do I save all this madness here in the nightstand drawer
there to haunt upon my shoulders
baby I know I'd be luckier to walk around everywhere I go
with this blind and broken heart
that sleeps beneath my lapel
instead these blue valentines to remind me of my cardinal sin
i can never wash the guilt or get these bloodstains off my hands
and it takes a whole lot of whiskey to make these nightmares go away
and I cut my bleedin heart out every night and I'm gonna die just a little more
on each St. Valentine's day
don't you remember I promised I would write you
these blue valentines
blue valentines
blue valentines

# Bone Chain

She drove a big old Lincoln 
with suicide doors
and a sewing machine in the back
and a light bulb that looked like 
an alligator egg
was mounted up front on the hood
and she had an Easter bonnet that had been signed 
by Tennessee Ernie Ford
and she always had saw dust in her hair
and she cut two holes in the back of her dress
and she had these scapular wings
that were covered with feathers and electrical tape
and when she got good and drunk
she would sing about Elkheart, Indiana
where the wind is strong 
and folks mind their own business
and she had at least a hundred old baseballs 
that she'd taken from kids
and she collected bones of all kinds
and she lived in a trailer under a bridge
and she made her own whiskey and gave cigarettes to kids
and she'd been struck by lightning seven or eight times
and she hated the mention of rain
and she made up her own language
and she wore rubber boots
and she could fix anything with string
and her lips were like cherries
and she was stronger than any man
and she smelled like gasoline and root beer fizz
and she put mud on a bee sting 
I got at the creek
and she gave me 
my very first kiss
and she gave me 
my very first kiss
talking 'bout my little Kathleen
she's just a fine young thing
someday she'll wear my ring
my little Kathleen

# Books Of Moses

Books of Moses
bringing stone news
wet in the water
weeping in the sun
Books of Moses
got some splinters 
didn't you?
Books of Moses 
brought me right here 
back to you
flaming heart 
ain't it sweet
lighting the world 
at your feet
Books of Moses 
myth and truth
Books of Moses
bring me back to you
hero's welcome
there stands your king
where the serpent shudders
and the angels sing
Books of Moses
happening again
yes he knows us
well welcome him
your friend
Books of Moses
bringing stone news
wet is the water
blood covering the sun
Books of Moses 
myth and truth
Books of Moses
bring me back to you

# Bottom Of The World

my daddy told me looking back
the best friend you'll have is a railroad track
so when I was 13 said I'm rolling my own
I'm leaving Missouri and I'm never coming home
I'm lost and I'm lost
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
Satchel Pudding and Lord God Mose
sitting by the fire with a busted nose
that fresh egg yeller is too damn rare
but the white part is perfect for slicking down your hair
I'm lost and I'm lost
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
Blackjack Ruby and Nimrod Cain
the moon is the color of a coffee stain
Jesse Frank and Birdy Joe Hoaks
but who is the king of all these folks
I'm lost and I'm lost
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
well I dined last night with Scarface Ron
on tilapia fish cakes and fried black swan
razor weed onion and peacock squirrel
and I dreamed all night about a beautiful girl
I'm lost and I'm lost
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
god's green hair is where I slept last
he balanced a diamond on a blade of grass
now I woke me up with a cardinal bird
and when I want to talk he hangs on every word
and I'm lost and I'm lost
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar
I'm lost at the bottom of the world

# The Briar And The Rose

I fell asleep down by the stream
And there I had the strangest dream
And down by Brennan's Glenn there grows
A briar and a rose
There's a tree in the forest
But I don't know where
I built a nest out of your hair
And climbing up into the air
A briar and a rose
I don't know how long it has been
But I was born in Brennan's Glenn
And near the end of spring there grows
A briar and a rose
I picked the rose one early morn
I pricked my finger on a thorn
They'd grown so high
It's winding wove the briar around the rose
I tried to tear them both apart
I felt a bullet in my heart
And all dressed up in springs new clothes
The briar and the rose
And when I'm buried in my grave
Tell me so I will know
Your tears will fall
To make love grow
The briar and the rose

# Broken Bicycles

Broken bicycles 
old busted chains
with rusted handlebars 
out in the rain
somebody must have 
an orphanage for
all these things that 
nobody wants any more
September is reminding July
it's time to be saying goodbye
summer is gone 
but our love will remain
like old broken bicycles 
out in the rain
broken bicycles 
don't tell my folks
there's all those playing cards 
pinned to the spokes
laid down like skeletons 
out on the lawn
the wheels won't turn 
when the other has gone
the seasons can turn on a dime
somehow I forget every time
for all the things that 
you've given me 
will always stay
broken but I'll never throw them away

# Burma Shave
Licorice tattoo turned a gun metal blue
Scrawled across the shoulders of a dying town
Took the one eyed jacks across the railroad tracks
And the scar on its belly pulled a stranger passing through
He's a juvenile delinquent never learned how to behave
But the cops would never think to look in Burma-Shave
And the road was like a ribbon and the moon was like a bone
He didn't seem to be like any guy she'd ever known
He kind of looked like Farley Granger with his hair slicked back
She says I'm a sucker for a fella in a cowboy hat
How far are you going?
Said Depends on what you mean
He says I'm only stopping here to get some gasoline
I guess I'm going thataway just as long as it's paved
And I guess you'd say I'm on my way to Burma Shave
And with her knees up on the glove compartment
She took out her barrettes and her hair spilled out like root beer
And she popped her gum and arched her back
Hell Marysville ain't nothing but a wide spot in the road
Some nights my heart pounds like thunder
Don't know why it don't explode
Cause everyone in this stinking town's got one foot in the grave
And I'd rather take my chances out in Burma Shave
Presley's what I go by why don't you change the stations
Count the grain elevators in the rearview mirror
She said mister anywhere you point this thing
It got to beat the hell out of the sting
Of going to bed with every dream that dies here every mornin
And so drill me a hole with a barber pole
And I'm jumping my parole just like a fugitive tonight
Why don't you have another swig and pass that car if you're so brave
I wanna get there before the sun comes up in Burma Shave
And the spider web crack and the mustang screamed
The smoke from the tires and the twisted machine
Just a nickel's worth of dreams and every wishbone that they saved
Lie swindled from them on the way to Burma Shave
And the sun hit the derrick and cast a bat wing shadow
Up against the car door on the shotgun side
And when they pulled her from the wreck
You know she still had on her shades
They say that dreams are growing wild
Just this side
Of Burma Shave

# Buzz Fledderjohn

I stood on the roof of Stuart's old Dodge
to get a better look at the Fledderjohn's lodge
bait shop pistols 
and ammo too
Nothing but books 
about World War II
rottweiler doberman
a Pinkerton guard
I ain't allowed in Buzz Fledderjohn's yard
I ain't allowed
no I ain't allowed
I said I ain't allowed in Buzz Fledderjohn's yard
I seen a python swallowing a Dobermann whole
piranha swimming in a mixing bowl
paper is full of stabbings 
the sky's full of crows
she's singing in Italian 
while she's hanging out her clothes
carp in the bathtub 
and it's raining real hard
I ain't allowed in Buzz Fledderjohn's yard
I said that I ain't allowed
no I ain't allowed
no I ain't allowed in Buzz Fledderjohn's yard
well a sailor's ringing doorbells 
the sinner's in the pew
weather vane squeaking to the west
I seen the cliffs of Dover 
and the deepest ocean blue
one thing in the world I can't recommend to you
cause I ain't allowed
I said I ain't allowed
no I ain't allowed in Buzz Fledderjohn's yard
I said I ain't allowed
no I ain't allowed
I ain't allowed in Buzz Fledderjohn's yard
I ain't allowed
I ain't allowed
I said I ain't allowed in Buzz Fledderjohn's yard
