# A Good Man Is Hard To Find

A good man is hard to find only strangers sleep in my bed
My favorite words are good-bye
And my favorite color is red
I always play Russian Roulette in my head
It's seventeen black and twenty-nine red
How far from the gutter; how far from the pew
I'll always remember to forget about you
A good man is hard to find
Only strangers sleep in my bed
My favorite words are good-bye
And my favorite color is red
A long dead soldier looks out from the frame
No one remembers his war; no one remembers his name
Go out to the meadow; scare off all the crows
It does nothing but rain here, and nothing will grow
A good man is hard to find
Only strangers sleep in my bed
My favorite words are good-bye
And my favorite color is red

# A Little Rain

The Ice Man's mule is parked outside the bar
Where a man with missing fingers plays a strange guitar
And the German dwarf dances with the butcher's son
And a little rain never hurt noone
And a little rain never hurt noone
They're dancing on the roof and the ceiling's coming down
I sleep with my shovel and my leather gloves
A little trouble makes it worth the going
And a little rain never hurt noone
The world is round
And so I'll go around
You must risk something that matters
My hands are strong
I'll take any man here
If it's worth the going
It's worth the ride
She was 15 years old and never seen the ocean
She climbed into a van with a vagabond
And the last thing she said was "I love you mom" 
And a little rain never hurt noone
And a little rain never hurt noone

# A Sight For Sore Eyes

A sight for sore eyes it's a long time no see
Working hard hardly working hey man you know me
Water under the bridge did you see my new car
Well it's bought and it's paid for parked outside of the bar
And hey barkeep what's keeping you keep pouring drinks
For all these palookas hey you know what I thinks
That we toast to the old days and DiMaggio too
And old Drysdale and Mantle Whitey Ford and to you
Oh you know the old gang ain't around everyone has left town
Except for Thumm and Giardina said they just might be down
Oh half drunk all the time and I'm all drunk the rest
Yeah Monk's still the champion oh but I am the best
And hey barkeep what's keeping you keep pouring drinks
For all these palookas hey you know what I thinks
That we toast to the old days and DiMaggio too
And old Drysdale and Mantle Whitey Ford and to you
Guess you heard about Nash he was killed in a crash
Oh that must have been two or three years ago now
Yeah he spun out and he rolled he hit a telephone pole
And he died with the radio on
No she's married with a kid finally split up with Sid
He's up north for a nickel's worth for armed robbery
And I'll play you some pinball no you ain't got a chance
Then go on over and ask her to dance
And hey barkeep what's keeping you keep pouring drinks
For all these palookas hey you know what I thinks
That we toast to the old days and DiMaggio too
And Drysdale and Mantle Whitey Ford and to you

# A Sweet Little Bullet from a Pretty Blue Gun

Well it's raining it's pouring
you didn't bring a sweater
Nebraska will never let you come back home
Now on Hollywood and Vine
by the Thrifty Mart sign
any night I'll be willin to bet
there's a young girl
with sweet little dreams and pretty blue wishes
standin there just gettin all wet
Now there's a place off the drag
called the Gilbert Hotel
and there's a couple letters
burned out in the sign
and it's better than a bus stop
they do good business every time it rains
for little girls with nothing in their jeans
but pretty blue wishes and sweet little dreams
and its raining its pouring
the old man is snoring
now I lay me down to sleep
I hear the sirens in the street
all my dreams are made of chrome
I have no way to get back home
I'd rather die before I wake
like Marilyn Monroe(7)
and you could throw my dreams out in the street
and let the rain make 'em grow
now the night clerk he got a club foot
he's heard every hard luck story
at least a hundred times or more
he says check out time is 10 am
and thats just what it means
go on up the stairs
with sweet little wishes and pretty blue dreams
and it's raining its pouring
and Hollywood's just fine
swindle a little girl out of her dreams
another letter in the sign
now never trust a scarecrow wearin shades after dark
be careful of that old bow tie he wears
it takes a sweet little bullet from a pretty blue gun
to put those scarlet ribbons in your hair
no that ain't no cherry bomb
fourth of July's all done
just some fool playin that second line
from the barrel of a pretty blue gun
o that ain't no cherry bomb
fourth of July's all done
just some fool playin that second line
from the barrel of a pretty blue gun

# Alice

It's dreamy weather we're on
You wave your crooked wand
Along an icy pond
With a frozen moon
A murder of silhouette crows I saw...
And the tears on my face
And the skates on the pond they spell Alice
I'll disappear in your name
But you must wait for me
Somewhere beneath the sea
There's the wreck of a ship
Your hair is like meadow grass
On the tide And the raindrops on my window
And the ice in my drink
Baby, all that I can think of Is Alice
Arithmetic Arithmetock I turn the hands back on the clock
How does the ocean rock the boat
How did the razor find my throat
The only strings that hold me here
Are tangled up around the pier
And so a secret kiss
Brings madness with the bliss
And I will think of this
When I'm dead in my grave
Set me adrift and I'm lost over there
But I must be insane
To go skating on your name
And by tracing it twice
I fell through the ice Of Alice
There's only Alice

# All Stripped Down

Well the time will come
When the wind will shout
All stripped down 
All stripped down
And all the sinners know
What I'm talking about
All stripped down 
All stripped down
When all the creatures of the world
Are gonna line up at the gate
All stripped down All stripped down
And you better be on time
And you better not be late
All stripped 
All stripped down
Well, you know in your heart
What you gotta bring
All stripped down
All stripped down
No big mink coat
No diamond ring
All stripped down 
All stripped down
Well take off your paint
And take off your rouge
All stripped down 
All stripped down
Let your backbone flip
And let your spirit shine thru
I want you all stripped
All stripped
All stripped down
All the men we got
Well they're goin' down the drain
All stripped down 
All stripped down
And when I see your sadness
On a river of shame
All stripped down 
All stripped down
You got to raise up
Both the quick and the dead
All stripped down 
All stripped down
With no shoes on your feet
No hat on your head
I want you all stripped 
All stripped 
All stripped down
Ain't nothin' in my heart
But fire for you
All stripped down 
All stripped down
With my rainy hammer
And a heart that's true
All stripped 
All stripped down

#All The World Is Green

I fell into the ocean
When you became my wife
I risked it all against the sea
To have a better life
Marie you're the wild blue sky
And men do foolish things
You turn kings into beggars
And beggars into kings
Pretend that you owe me nothing
And all the world is green
We can bring back the old
days again
And all the world is green
The face forgives the mirror
The worm forgives the plow
The questions begs the answer
Can you forgive me somehow
Maybe when our story's over
We'll go where it's always spring
The band is playing our song again
And all the world is green
Pretend that you owe me nothing
And all the world is green
We can bring back the old
days again
And all the world is green
The moon is yellow silver
Oh the things that summer brings
It's a love you'd kill for
And all the world is green
He is balancing a diamond
On a blade of grass
The dew will settle on our grave
When all the world is green

# Altar Boy

He's an ol' altar boy lying out there in the street
he's an ol' altar boy bound up in leather and chains
that's why I'm feeling so blue
I'm an old altar boy
what about you
now I can order in Latin
make 'em au gratin Joe
I'm an old altar boy
that's why I'm so depressed
I never got the rest of the dream
just the ritual
now I'm habitual
majoring in crimes 
that are unspeakable
cause I'm an old altar boy
that's what happened to me
I'm an old altar boy
he's hoping he can meet a woman 
dressed like a nun
he knows there's got to be some around here
drinking across from the church
a little Father Cribari wine
on a Sunday morn' time
I'm an old altar boy
why is he winking at this time in his life
he never took a wife 
cause he's an old altar boy
oh yeah
what about you

# Another Man's Vine

Bougainvillea's bloom and wind
Be careful mind the strangle vines
The rose is climbing over blind
Cause the sun is on the other side
The bees will find their honey
The sweetest every time
Around a Red Rose
I see a red rose, a red rose
Blooming on another man's vine
Golden Willie's gone to war
He left his young wife on the shore
Will she be steadfast everyday?
While Golden Willie is far away
Along the way her letters end
She never reads what Willie sends
Now I see a red rose
I smell a red rose
A red rose
Blooming on another man's vine

# Around a Red Rose

I see a red rose, a red rose
Blooming on another man's vine
Golden Willie's gone to war
He left his young wife on the shore
Will she be steadfast everyday?
While Golden Willie is far away
Along the way her letters end
She never reads what Willie sends
Now I see a red rose
I smell a red rose
A red rose
Blooming on another man's vine
Anywhere I Lay My Head
My head is spinning round
My heart is in my shoes
I went and set the Thames on fire
Now I must come back down
She's laughing in her sleeve at me
I can feel it in my bones
But anywhere I'm gonna 
Lay my head, boys
I'm will call my home
Well I see that 
The world is upside down
My pockets were filled up with gold
Now the clouds have covered o'er
And the wind is blowing cold
I don't need anybody
Because I learned to be alone
And anywhere 
I lay my head, boys
I will call my home

# Army Ants

The whirligig beetles are wary and fast 
with an organ to detect the ripples
the arachnid moths lay their eggs inside 
other insects along the borders of fields or roads 
in clusters of white cocoons
the ribbed pine borer is a longhorn beetle 
their antenna's are half the length of their body 
and they feed on dead red pine
robber flies with their immobile heads
inject a paralyzing fluid into their prey 
that they snatch from life in mid-air
the snow flea's mode of locomotion
strange and odd 
with a spiny tail mechanism with hooks 
and a protracted tube from the abdomen 
to enable moisture absorption
the female praying mantis devours the male 
while they are mating 
the male sometimes continues copulating 
even after the female has bitten off his head 
and part of his upper torso
every night wasps bite into the stem of a plant
lock their mandibles into position
stretch out at right angles to the stem and
with legs dangling they fall asleep
if one places a minute amount of liquor 
on a scorpion
it will instantly go mad and 
sting itself to death
the bombardier beetle 
when disturbed 
defends itself by emitting a series of explosions
sometimes setting off four or five reports in succession
the noises sound like miniature popgun blasts 
and are accompanied by a cloud of 
reddish coloured vile smelling fluid
it is commonly known that ants keep slaves
certain species 
the so-called sanguinary ants 
in particular
will raid the nests of other ant tribes 
and kill the queen and then kidnap many of the workers
the workers are brought back to the captor's hive 
where they are coerced into performing menial tasks
and as we discussed last semester 
the army ants will leave nothing but your bones
perhaps you've encountered some of these insects 
in your communities 
displaying both their predatory and defense characteristics
while embedded within the walls of flesh 
and passing for what is most commonly recognized
as human

# Baby Gonna Leave Me

Well I stood on the corner
Til my feet got wet
I stood by the faucet
Till the sink filled up
I stood by the window
Till the moon came up
My baby bought a ticket
Long as my clothes line
Na na na na na
My baby went and left me
In a '49 Ford
Going down the highway in a
49 sword
my baby ripped my heart out
with every turn of the moon
somebody told me there's
never been a rose without a thorn
na na na na na na
na na na na na na
And if I was a tree
I'd be a cut down tree
And if I was a bed 
I'd be an unmade bed
I'll get my 32/20 and it'll
Have to do
Na na na na na na
Gone like the wind in 
The meadow
And the rain on the hill
You even left your lipstick
And your powder and your blush
Baby gonna leave me
On a Grey Hound Bus
The stars are melting
All across the sky
Na na na na na 
I let the dog out
But he didn't come back
Stood on the corner till
My feet got wet
Baby gonna leave me in a 49 Ford
I stood by the window
Till the moon came up
Na na na na na 
Na na na na na

#Back In The Crowd

If you don’t want these arms to hold you
If you don’t want these lips to kiss you
If you’ve found somebody new
Put me back in the crowd
Put the sun behind the clouds
Put me back in the crowd
There’s a battle going on
Between the blue and the grey
And if you don’t want my love
Don’t make me stay
Take back your name
Take back these wings
Take my picture from the frame
And put me back in the crowd
Put the sun behind the cloud
Put me back in the crowd
Put me back in the crowd
Put the sun behind the cloud
Put me back in the crowd

#Back In The Good Old World

When I was a boy, the moon was a pearl the sun a yellow gold.
But when I was a man, the wind blew cold the hills were upside down.
But now that I have gone from here there's no place I'd rather be than to float my chances on the tide, back in the good old world.
On October's last I'll fly back home rolling down winding way.
Scare crows are all dressed in rags out at the edge of the field I lay and all I've got's a pocket full of flowers on my grave.
Oh but summer is gone I remember it best back in the good old world

# Bad As Me

You’re the head on the spear
You’re the nail on the cross
You’re the fly in my beer
You’re the key that got lost
You’re the letter from Jesus on the bathroom wall
You’re mother superior in only a bra
You’re the same kind of bad as me
I’m the hat on the bed
I’m the coffee instead
The fish or cut bait
I’m the detective up late
I’m the blood on the floor
The thunder and the roar
The boat that won’t sink
I just won’t sleep a wink
You’re the same kind of bad as me
No good you say
Well that’s good enough for me
You’re the wreath that caught fire
You’re the preach to the choir
You bite down on the sheet
But your teeth have been wired
You skid in the rain
You’re trying to shift
You’re grinding the gears
You’re trying to shift
And you’re the same kind of bad as me
They told me you were no good
I know you’ll take care of all my needs
You’re the same kind of bad as me
I’m the mattress in the back
I’m the old gunnysack
I’m the one with the gun
Most likely to run
I’m the car in the weeds
If you cut me I’ll bleed
You’re the same kind of bad as me
You’re the same kind of bad as me

# Bad Liver And A Broken Heart

Well I got a bad liver and a broken heart
yea I drunk me a river since you tore me apart
and I don't have a drinking problem 
cept when I can't get a drink
and I wish you'd a known her 
we were quite a pair
she was sharp as a razor 
and soft as a prayer
so welcome to the continuing saga
she was my better half 
and I was just a dog
and so here am I slumped
I been chippied and I been chumped 
on my stool
so buy this fool, some spirits and libations
it's these railroad station bars
with all these conductors and the porters
and I'm all out of quarters
and this epitaph is the aftermath
yea I choose my path 
hey come on Cath, he's a lawyer 
he ain't the one for ya
and no the moon ain't romantic 
it's intimidating as hell
and some guy's tryin to sell 
me a watch
and so I'll meet you at the 
bottom of a bottle of 
bargain scotch
I got me a bottle and a dream
it's so maudlin it seems
you can name your poison
go on ahead and make some noise 
I ain't sentimental
this ain't a purchase it's a rental 
and it's purgatory, hey 
what's your story, well 
I don't even care
cause I got my own double-cross to bear
and I'll see your Red Label 
and I'll raise you one more
and you can pour me a cab 
I just can't drink no more
cause it don't douse the flames
that are started by dames 
it ain't like asbestos
it don't do nothing but 
rest us assured
and substantiate the rumors 
that you've heard

# Barber Shop

Good morning mister snip snip snip
With your hair cut just as short as mine
Good morning mister snip snip snip
With your hair cut just as short as mine
Bay rum lucky tiger butch wax cracker jacks
Shoe shine jaw breaker magazine racks
Hanging round the barber shop a side-burning close crop
Morning Mr. Furgeson what's the good word with you
Staying out of trouble like a good boy should
I see you're still cutting hair I'm still cutting classes
I got a couple passes to the ringle bros barn bail circus afternoon
You lost a little round the middle and you're looking real good
Sitting on the wagon instead of under the hood
What's the low-down Mr. Brown I heard your boy's leaving town
I bought myself a struggle buggy sucker's powder blue
Throw me over the sports page Cincinnati looking good
I always been for Pittsburgh and I lay you 10 to 1
The Pirates get the pennant and the series before their done
The hair's getting longer you know the skirts are getting shorter
And don't you know that you can get a cheaper haircut 
If you wanna cross the border
If your mama saw you smoking well she'd kick your ass
Now you put it out you juvenile and put it out fast
Well if I had a million dollars what would I do
I'd probably be a barber not a bum like you
Still got your paper route now that's just fine
And you can pay me double because you gypped me last time
And don't you know that you can keep a little circus money 
And spend it on a girl
And just remember that I give the best haircuts 
In the whole wide world
I give the best haircuts in the whole wide world
Good morning mister snip snip snip
With your hair cut just as short as mine
Good morning mister snip snip snip
With your hair cut just as short as mine

# Barcarolle

A cloud lets go of the moon
Her ribbons are all out of tune
She's skating on the ice in a glass
And in the hands of a man
That she kissed on a train
The children have all gone into town
To get candy and we are
Alone in the house here
And your eyes fall down on me
And I belong only to you
The water is filling my shoes
In the wine of my heart there's a stone
In a well made of bone I will bring to the pond
And she's here in your pocket
And curled up in a dollar
And the chain from your watch
Around her neck
And I'll stay right here till it's time
The girls all knit in the shade
Before the baby is made
The branches bend down to the ground
Here to swing on
And I'm lost in the blond summer grass
And the train whistle blows
And the carnival goes
Till there's only the tickets and crows
But the grass will all grow back
And the branches Spell Alice
And I belong to you

# Bend Down The Branches

The sky is as deep as it can be
bend down the branches
close your eyes and you will see
bend down the branches
you're like a willow
once you were gold
we're made for bending
even beauty gets old
climb the stairs they're not so steep
bend down the branches
close your eyes and go to sleep
bend down the branches

# Better Off Without A Wife

All my friends are married
Every Tom and Dick and Harry
You must be strong if you're to go it alone
Here's to the bachelors and the Bowery bums
Those who feel that they're the ones
That are better off without a wife
Cause I like to sleep until the crack of noon
Midnight howling at the moon
Going out when I want to,
And I'm coming home when I please
Don't have to ask permission
If I wanna go out fishing
Never have to ask for the keys
I've never been no Valentino
But I had a girl who lived in Reno
Left me for a trumpet player
Well, it didn't get me down
He was wanted for assault
And though he said it weren't his fault
You know the coppers rode him right out of town
I'll be sleeping until the crack of noon
Midnight howling at the moon
And I'll be going out when I want to
Coming home when I please
Don't have to ask permission
If I wanna go out fishing
Never have to ask for the keys
Yeah, you see I'm kinda selfish about my privacy
Now as long as I can be with me
We get along so well I can't even believe it
I love to chew the fat with folks
I'll be listening to all your dirty jokes
I'm so thankful for these friends I do receive
I'll be sleeping until the crack of noon
Midnight howling at the moon
And I'll be going out when I want to
Coming home when I please
Don't have to ask permission
If I wanna go out fishing
Never have to ask for the keys, no
Hey, I got this girl I know, man, and I just
She's been married several times and
I don't wanna end up like her
I mean, she's been married so many times
She's got rice-marks all over her face
Yeah, you know the kind

# Big Black Mariah

Big Black Mariah
Cuttin' through the cane break 
Rattling the sill
Thunder that the rain makes 
When the shadow tops the hill
Big light on the back street 
Hill to Evermore. Packin' down the ladder 
With the hammer to the floor
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Ford
Well he's all boxed up 
On a red bell dame
Hunted Black Johnny with 
A blind man's cane
A yellow bullet with a 
Rag out in the wind
An old blind tiger 
Get an old bell Jim
Here comes the Big Black 
Mariah. Here comes the Big Black 
Mariah. Here comes the Big Black 
Mariah. Here comes the Big Black Ford
Sent to the skies on a 
Benny Jag Blue
Off to bed without his supper 
Like the Linda brides do
Now he's got to do the story 
With the old widow Jones...
He's got a wooden coat this boy 
Is never coming home
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Ford
Cut through the 
Cane break...
Well he's all boxed up 
On a red bell dame
Hunted Black Johnny with

A yellow bullet with a 
Rag out in the wind
An old blind tiger 
Get an old bell Jim

# Big Joe And Phantom 309

See, I just happened to be back on the East coast a few years back
I was trying to make me a buck like everybody else
I'll be damned if times didn't get hard, and Christ I got down on my luck
And I got tired of just roaming and bumming around
So I started thumbing my way back to my old hometown
And you know, I made quite a few miles in the first couple of days
You know, I figured I'd be home in a week if my luck held out this way
You know, it was the third night, oh and I got stranded
And it was out at a cold lonely crossroads
And as the rain came pouring down, man I was hungry
Yeah, I was hungry, tired and freezing, caught myself a chill
But it was just about that time
Yeah, it was just about that time that the lights of an old semi topped the hill
You should've seen me smile when I heard them air brakes come on
Yeah, and I climbed up into that cab where I knew it'd be warm
At the wheel... well, at the wheel sat a big man
And I'd have to say he must've weighed two ten
As he stuck out a big hand and he said with a grin
'Big Joe's the name, and this here rig is called Phantom 309'
Well, I asked him why he called his rig such a name
And you know, he turned to me and said 
'Why son, don't you know this here rig'll be putting 'em all to shame
Nah, there ain't a driver
No, there ain't a driver on this or any other line for that matter that
That's seen nothing but the taillights of Big Joe and Phantom 309'
So we rode and we talked the better part of the night
And I told my stories and Joe told his
And I smoked up all his Viceroys as we rolled along
Pushed her ahead with ten forward gears
Man, that dashboard was lit like the old Madame La Rue pinball
Serious semi-truck
'Til almost mysteriously
Well, it was the lights of a truck stop that rolled into sight
Joe turned to me, said 'I'm sorry son, but I'm afraid this is just as far as you go, you see
You see, I kinda gotta be making a turn just up the road a piece'
I'll be damned if he didn't toss me a dime as he threw her in low and said
'Go on in there son, and get yourself a hot cup of coffee on Big Joe'
I mean to tell you, when Joe and his rig pulled off into the night
Man, in nothing flat they was clean outta sight
So I walked into this stop, well I ordered me up a cup of mud
Saying 'Big Joe's setting this dude up'
But it got so deadly quiet in that place
Yeah, it got so deadly quiet in that place, you could've heard a pin drop
And as the waiter's face turned kind of pale I said
'What's the matter, did I say something wrong?'
I kind of said with a half way grin
He said, 'No son, you see it'll kinda happen every now and then
'Cause every driver in here knows Big Joe, son, but
But let me tell you what happened just ten years ago out there
Yeah, it was years ago, out there at that cold lonely crossroads
And there was a whole busload of kids
And then they were just coming from school
And they were right in the middle when Joe topped the hill and
They could've been slaughtered except Joe turned his wheels
And he jackknifed, yeah he jackknifed, and he went into a skid
And you know, folks around here, well
They say he gave his life to save that bunch of kids
And out there at that cold lonely crossroads
Well, they're saying it was the end of the line for Big Joe and Phantom 309
But it's funny you know, cause... cause every now and then
Yeah, every now and then when the moon's holding water
Well, they say that old Joe'll stop and give you a ride
It seems, just like you, some hitchhiker will be coming by'
'So here, son,' he said to me, 'you get yourself another cup of coffee
It's on the house, I kind of want you to hang on to that dime
Yeah, I kind of want you to hang on to that dime as a souvenir
I want you to keep that dime as a souvenir of Big Joe
Of Big Joe and Phantom
Big Joe and Phantom 309'

# Black Market Baby

She lives in a house
that's way back off the road
There's a man with a lantern
and he carries her soul
A coal stove and a bed
A skillet and a hound
She drove a camel through
A needle
In this sinking board walk town
She's my Black Market baby
She's my Black Market baby
She's a diamond that
wants to stay coal
wants to stay coal
I swang out wide with her
on hells iron gate
Anything that you wanted 
you could have
My eyes say their prayers to her
sailors ring her bell
Like a moth mistakes a light bulb
For the moon and goes to hell
She's my Black Market baby
She's my Black Market baby
She's a diamond that
wants to stay coal
wants to stay coal
There's no prayer like desire
There's amnesia in her kiss
She's a swan and a pistol
and she will follow you like this
In Moberly, Missouri at the
Iroquois Hotel 
She checked in with the President
and she ran up quite a Bill
(Chorus)
She's whiskey in a teacup
She gives blondes a lousy name
She's a Bonzai Aphrodite
and a ticket back to Spain
She's a hard way to go
and there ain't no way
to stop
Every time you play the red
the black is coming up
She's my Black Market baby
She's my Black Market baby
She's a diamond that
Wants to stay coal
Wants to stay coal

#The Black Rider

Come on along with the Black Rider
We'll have a gay old time
Lay down in the web of the black spider
I'll drink your blood like wine
So come on in
it ain't no sin
take off your skin
and dance around in your bones
So come on along with the Black Rider
We'll have a gay old time
Anchors away with the Black Rider
I'll drink your blood like wine
I'll drop you off in Harlem with the Black Rider
Out where the bullets shine
And when you're done
you cock your gun
the blood will run
like ribbons through your hair
So come on along with the Black Rider
We'll have a gay old time
Come on along with the Black Rider
I've got just the thing for thee
Come on along with the Black Rider
I want your company
I'll have the veal
a lovely meal
that's how I feel
May I use your skull for a bowl
Come on along with the Black Rider
We'll have a gay old time

# Black Wings

Take an eye for an eye
Take a tooth for a tooth
Just like they say in the Bible
Never leave a trace or forget a face
Of any man at the table
Any man at the table
When the moon is a cold chiseled dagger
Sharp enough to draw blood from a stone
He rides through your dreams on a coach 
And horses and the fence posts 
In the moonlight look like bones.
Well they've stopped trying to hold him
With mortar, stone and chain
He broke out of every prison
Boots mount the staircase
The door is flung back open
He's not there for he has risen,
He's not there for he has risen
Well he once killed a man with a guitar string
He's been seen at the table with kings
Well he once saved a baby from drowning
There are those that say beneath his coat there are wings
Some say they fear him
Others admire him
Because he steals his promise
One look in his eye
Everyone denies
Ever having met him
Ever having met him
He can turn himself into a stranger
Well they broke a lot of canes on his hide
He was born away in a cornfield
A fever beats in his head like a drum inside
Some say they fear him
Others admire him
Because he steals his promise
One look in his eye
Everyone denies
Ever having met him
Ever having met him

# Blind Love

Now you're gone
And it's hotels and whiskey and sad luck dames
and I don't care if they miss me
and I never remember their names
they say if you get far enough away
you'll be on your way back home
well I'm at the station
and I can't get on the train
it must be blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
Blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
With your blind love
With your blind love
Stone blind love
With your blind love
Now the streets are turning blue
and the dogs are barking 
and the night has come
and there are tears that are falling
from your blue eyes now
Well I wonder where you are
and I whisper your name
The only way to find you
is if I close my eyes
I'll find you with my blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
It's your blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
Stone blind love
Only kind of love is stone blind love
With your blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
Stone blind love
Stone blind love
Oh it's blind love
Blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
With your blind love
Oh it's blind love
Blind love
With your stone blind love

# Blow Wind Blow

Mary's on the black top
There's a husband in 
the dog house
In the middle of a shakedown
She got 
quiet as a church mouse
She found Raleigh's on 
the dashboard
Sugar daddy caught a polocar
Ain't no solitary 
tap dance way down here
I swear I's ridin
on a field mouse
we were dancin' in the slaughterhouse
If you swing along the beltway
then you skid along the all day
cause I went a little crazy
and I sat upon a high chair
And I'm smokin like a diesel
way out here
Blow wind blow- blow me away here-
blow wind blow (repeat)

# Blue Valentines

She sends me blue valentines all the way from Philadelphia
to mark the anniversary of someone that I used to be
And it feels like a warrant is out for my arrest
baby you got me checkin in my rearview mirror
thats why I'm always on the run it's why I changed my name
and I didn't think you'd ever find me here
to send me blue valentines like half forgotten dreams
like a pebble in my shoe as I walk these streets
and the ghost of your memory baby its the thistle in the kiss
its the burglar that can break a rose's neck
its the tatooed broken promise I gotta hide beneath my sleeve
I'm gonna see you every time I turn my back
oh you send me blue valentines though I try to remain at large
they're insisting that our love must have a eulogy
why do I save all this madness here in the nightstand drawer
there to haunt upon my shoulders
baby I know I'd be luckier to walk around everywhere I go
with this blind and broken heart
that sleeps beneath my lapel
instead these blue valentines to remind me of my cardinal sin
i can never wash the guilt or get these bloodstains off my hands
and it takes a whole lot of whiskey to make these nightmares go away
and I cut my bleedin heart out every night and I'm gonna die just a little more
on each St. Valentine's day
don't you remember I promised I would write you
these blue valentines
blue valentines
blue valentines

# Bone Chain

She drove a big old Lincoln 
with suicide doors
and a sewing machine in the back
and a light bulb that looked like 
an alligator egg
was mounted up front on the hood
and she had an Easter bonnet that had been signed 
by Tennessee Ernie Ford
and she always had saw dust in her hair
and she cut two holes in the back of her dress
and she had these scapular wings
that were covered with feathers and electrical tape
and when she got good and drunk
she would sing about Elkheart, Indiana
where the wind is strong 
and folks mind their own business
and she had at least a hundred old baseballs 
that she'd taken from kids
and she collected bones of all kinds
and she lived in a trailer under a bridge
and she made her own whiskey and gave cigarettes to kids
and she'd been struck by lightning seven or eight times
and she hated the mention of rain
and she made up her own language
and she wore rubber boots
and she could fix anything with string
and her lips were like cherries
and she was stronger than any man
and she smelled like gasoline and root beer fizz
and she put mud on a bee sting 
I got at the creek
and she gave me 
my very first kiss
and she gave me 
my very first kiss
talking 'bout my little Kathleen
she's just a fine young thing
someday she'll wear my ring
my little Kathleen

# Books Of Moses

Books of Moses
bringing stone news
wet in the water
weeping in the sun
Books of Moses
got some splinters 
didn't you?
Books of Moses 
brought me right here 
back to you
flaming heart 
ain't it sweet
lighting the world 
at your feet
Books of Moses 
myth and truth
Books of Moses
bring me back to you
hero's welcome
there stands your king
where the serpent shudders
and the angels sing
Books of Moses
happening again
yes he knows us
well welcome him
your friend
Books of Moses
bringing stone news
wet is the water
blood covering the sun
Books of Moses 
myth and truth
Books of Moses
bring me back to you

# Bottom Of The World

my daddy told me looking back
the best friend you'll have is a railroad track
so when I was 13 said I'm rolling my own
I'm leaving Missouri and I'm never coming home
I'm lost and I'm lost
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
Satchel Pudding and Lord God Mose
sitting by the fire with a busted nose
that fresh egg yeller is too damn rare
but the white part is perfect for slicking down your hair
I'm lost and I'm lost
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
Blackjack Ruby and Nimrod Cain
the moon is the color of a coffee stain
Jesse Frank and Birdy Joe Hoaks
but who is the king of all these folks
I'm lost and I'm lost
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
well I dined last night with Scarface Ron
on tilapia fish cakes and fried black swan
razor weed onion and peacock squirrel
and I dreamed all night about a beautiful girl
I'm lost and I'm lost
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
god's green hair is where I slept last
he balanced a diamond on a blade of grass
now I woke me up with a cardinal bird
and when I want to talk he hangs on every word
and I'm lost and I'm lost
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar
I'm lost at the bottom of the world

# The Briar And The Rose

I fell asleep down by the stream
And there I had the strangest dream
And down by Brennan's Glenn there grows
A briar and a rose
There's a tree in the forest
But I don't know where
I built a nest out of your hair
And climbing up into the air
A briar and a rose
I don't know how long it has been
But I was born in Brennan's Glenn
And near the end of spring there grows
A briar and a rose
I picked the rose one early morn
I pricked my finger on a thorn
They'd grown so high
It's winding wove the briar around the rose
I tried to tear them both apart
I felt a bullet in my heart
And all dressed up in springs new clothes
The briar and the rose
And when I'm buried in my grave
Tell me so I will know
Your tears will fall
To make love grow
The briar and the rose

# Broken Bicycles

Broken bicycles 
old busted chains
with rusted handlebars 
out in the rain
somebody must have 
an orphanage for
all these things that 
nobody wants any more
September is reminding July
it's time to be saying goodbye
summer is gone 
but our love will remain
like old broken bicycles 
out in the rain
broken bicycles 
don't tell my folks
there's all those playing cards 
pinned to the spokes
laid down like skeletons 
out on the lawn
the wheels won't turn 
when the other has gone
the seasons can turn on a dime
somehow I forget every time
for all the things that 
you've given me 
will always stay
broken but I'll never throw them away

# Burma Shave
Licorice tattoo turned a gun metal blue
Scrawled across the shoulders of a dying town
Took the one eyed jacks across the railroad tracks
And the scar on its belly pulled a stranger passing through
He's a juvenile delinquent never learned how to behave
But the cops would never think to look in Burma-Shave
And the road was like a ribbon and the moon was like a bone
He didn't seem to be like any guy she'd ever known
He kind of looked like Farley Granger with his hair slicked back
She says I'm a sucker for a fella in a cowboy hat
How far are you going?
Said Depends on what you mean
He says I'm only stopping here to get some gasoline
I guess I'm going thataway just as long as it's paved
And I guess you'd say I'm on my way to Burma Shave
And with her knees up on the glove compartment
She took out her barrettes and her hair spilled out like root beer
And she popped her gum and arched her back
Hell Marysville ain't nothing but a wide spot in the road
Some nights my heart pounds like thunder
Don't know why it don't explode
Cause everyone in this stinking town's got one foot in the grave
And I'd rather take my chances out in Burma Shave
Presley's what I go by why don't you change the stations
Count the grain elevators in the rearview mirror
She said mister anywhere you point this thing
It got to beat the hell out of the sting
Of going to bed with every dream that dies here every mornin
And so drill me a hole with a barber pole
And I'm jumping my parole just like a fugitive tonight
Why don't you have another swig and pass that car if you're so brave
I wanna get there before the sun comes up in Burma Shave
And the spider web crack and the mustang screamed
The smoke from the tires and the twisted machine
Just a nickel's worth of dreams and every wishbone that they saved
Lie swindled from them on the way to Burma Shave
And the sun hit the derrick and cast a bat wing shadow
Up against the car door on the shotgun side
And when they pulled her from the wreck
You know she still had on her shades
They say that dreams are growing wild
Just this side
Of Burma Shave

# Buzz Fledderjohn

I stood on the roof of Stuart's old Dodge
to get a better look at the Fledderjohn's lodge
bait shop pistols 
and ammo too
Nothing but books 
about World War II
rottweiler doberman
a Pinkerton guard
I ain't allowed in Buzz Fledderjohn's yard
I ain't allowed
no I ain't allowed
I said I ain't allowed in Buzz Fledderjohn's yard
I seen a python swallowing a Dobermann whole
piranha swimming in a mixing bowl
paper is full of stabbings 
the sky's full of crows
she's singing in Italian 
while she's hanging out her clothes
carp in the bathtub 
and it's raining real hard
I ain't allowed in Buzz Fledderjohn's yard
I said that I ain't allowed
no I ain't allowed
no I ain't allowed in Buzz Fledderjohn's yard
well a sailor's ringing doorbells 
the sinner's in the pew
weather vane squeaking to the west
I seen the cliffs of Dover 
and the deepest ocean blue
one thing in the world I can't recommend to you
cause I ain't allowed
I said I ain't allowed
no I ain't allowed in Buzz Fledderjohn's yard
I said I ain't allowed
no I ain't allowed
I ain't allowed in Buzz Fledderjohn's yard
I ain't allowed
I ain't allowed
I said I ain't allowed in Buzz Fledderjohn's yard

# Candy Apple Red

I don't care if she never comes back
Sing: Candy Apple Red
And I'll never fall in love again
And that's for sure
Sing: Candy Apple Red.
I'm gonna drink just like a son of a bitch
Sing: Candy Apple Red
And drive my car into a drainage ditch
Singing: Candy Apple Red.

# Chicago

The seeds are planted here
But they won’t grow
We won’t have to say goodbye
If we all go
Maybe things will be better in Chicago
To leave all we’ve ever known
For a place we’ve never seen
Maybe things will be better in Chicago
Well It’s braver to stay
Even braver to go
Wherever she goes I go
Maybe things will be better in Chicago
What we need the lord will give us
All we want we carry with us
You know where I can be found
Where the rainbow hits the ground
I’m not alone
I’m not afraid
This bird has flown from his cage
There’s so much magic we have known
On this sapphire we call home
With my coat and my hat
I say goodbye to all that
Maybe things will be better in Chicago
Maybe things will be better in Chicago

# Children's Story

Once upon a time there was a poor child
with no father and no mother
and everything was dead
and no one was left in the whole world
everything was dead
and the child went on search day and night
and since nobody was left on the earth
he wanted to go up into the heavens
and the moon was looking at him so friendly
and when he finally got to the moon
the moon was a piece of rotten wood
and then he went to the sun
and when he got there 
the sun was a wilted sunflower
and when he got to the stars
they were little golden flies
stuck up there like the shrike 
sticks 'em on a blackthorn
And when he wanted to go back down to earth
the earth was an overturned piss pot
And he was all alone 
he sat down and he cried
and he is there till this day
all alone
okay there's your story
night night

# Chocolate Jesus

Don't go to church on Sunday
Don't get on my knees to pray
Don't memorize the books of the Bible
I got my own special way
But I know Jesus loves me
maybe just a little bit more
I fall on my knees every Sunday
At Zerelda Lee's candy store
Well it's got to be a chocolate Jesus
Make me feel good inside
Got to be a chocolate Jesus
Keep me satisfied
Well I don't want no Abba Zabba
Don't want no Almond Joy
There ain't nothing better
suitable for this boy
Well it's the only thing
that can pick me up
Better than a cup of gold
See only a chocolate Jesus
can satisfy my soul
When the weather gets rough
and it's whiskey in the shade
it's best to wrap your savior
up in cellophane
He flows like the big muddy
but that's ok
Pour him over ice cream
for a nice parfait
Well it's got to be a chocolate Jesus
good enough for me
Got to be a chocolate Jesus 
good enough for me
Well it's got to be a chocolate Jesus
make me feel good inside
Got to be a chocolate Jesus 
Keep me satisfied

# Christmas Card from a Hooker in Minneapolis

Hey Charlie I'm pregnant and living on 9th Street
right above a dirty bookstore off Euclid Avenue
and I stopped takin dope and I quit drinkin whiskey
and my old man plays the trombone and works out at the track
he says that he loves me even though it's not his baby
he says that he'll raise him up like he would his own son
and he gave me a ring that was worn by his mother
and he takes me out dancin every Saturday night
and hey Charlie I think about you everytime I pass a fillin station
on account of all the grease you used to wear in your hair
and I still have that record of Little Anthony and the Imperials
but someone stole my record player now how do you like that?
hey Charlie I almost went crazy after Mario got busted
I went back to Omaha to live with my folks
but everyone I used to know was either dead or in prison
so I came back to Minneapolis this time I think I'm gonna stay
hey Charlie I think I'm happy for the first time since my accident
and I wish I had all the money we used to spend on dope
I'd buy me a used car lot and I wouldn't sell any of em
I'd just drive a different car every day dependin on how I feel
hey Charlie for chrissakes if you want to know the truth of it
I don't have a husband he don't play the trombone
I need to borrow money to pay this lawyer and Charlie hey
I'll be eligible for parole come Valentine's day

# Circus

We put up our tent on a dark
Green knoll, outside of town by
The train tracks and a seagull dump
Topping the bill was Horse Face Ethel
And her Marvelous Pigs in satin
We pounded our steaks in the ground
All powder brown
And the branches spread like scary
Fingers reaching – we
Were in a pasture in Kankakee
And one eyed Myra, the queen of
The galley who trained the
Ostrich and the camels
She looked at me squinty with her 
One good eye in a Roy Orbison
t-shirt as she bottle fed
an Orangutan named
Tripod and then there was
Yodeling Elaine the
Queen of the air who wore a 
Dollar sign medallion and she
Had a tiny bubble of spittle
Around her nostril and a 
Little rusty tear, for she had
Lassoed and lost another
Tipsy sailor and over in
The burnt yellow tent
By the frozen tractor, the
Music was like electric sugar
And Zuzu Bolin played
"Stavin' Chain" and Mighty
Tiny on the saw and he
Threw his head back with a 
Mouth full of gold teeth
And they played lopsided heart
And moon over Dog Street and
By the time they played Moanin Low
I was soakin wet and wild eyed
And Doctor Bliss slipped me a 
Preparation and I fell asleep with
Livery Stable Blues in my ear
And me and Molly Hoey drank
Pruno and Koolaid she had a 
Tattoo gun made out of a cassette
Motor and a guitar string and 
she soaked a hanky in 3 roses
and rubbed it on the spot
and she drew a rickety heart and 
a bent arrow and it hurt like hell
and Funeral Wells spun
Poodle Murphy on the target
As he threw his hardware, only
Once in Sheboygan did he miss
At a matinee on Diamond Pier and
She'd never let him forget it
They were doing two shows and she
Had a high fever and he took
Off a piece of her ear and 
Tip Little told her she should
Leave the bum but
Poodle said, "he fetched me
Last time I run" and I'd 
Like to hammer this ring into
A bullet and I wish I
Had some whiskey and a gun
My dear, I wish I had some
Whiskey and a gun my dear

# Clang Boom Steam

Well my baby's so fine
Even her car looks good
From behind
Well my baby's so fine
Even her car looks good
From behind
But the train that took
My baby...
It went clang, boom and steam

# Clap Hands

Sane, sane, they're all insane
The fireman's blind, the conductor's lame
A Cincinnati jacket and a sad luck dame
Hanging out the window with a bottle full of rain
Clap hands. Clap hands
Clap hands. Clap hands
Said roar, roar the thunder and the roar
Son of a bitch is never comin' back here no more
Moon in the window, a bird on the pole
Can always find a millionaire to shovel all the coal
Clap hands. Clap hands
Clap hands. Clap hands
Steam, steam a hundred bad dreams
Goin' up to Harlem with a pistol in his jeans
A fifty dollar bill inside of Palladin's hat
And nobody's sure where Mr. Knickerbocker's at
Said roar, roar the thunder and the roar
Son of a bitch is never comin' back here no more
Moon in the window, a bird on the pole
Can always find a millionaire to shovel all the coal
Clap hands. Clap hands
Clap hands. Clap hands
Shine, shine a Roosevelt dime
All the way to Baltimore and runnin' out of time
Salvation Army seemed to wind up in the hole
They all went to Heaven in a little row boat
Clap hands. Clap hands
Clap hands. Clap hands

# Cold Cold Ground

Crest fallen sidekick in an old cafe
never slept with a dream before he had to go away
there's a bell in the tower 
Uncle Ray bought a round
don't worry bout the army 
in the cold cold ground
cold cold ground
now don't be a cry baby 
when there's wood in the shed
there's a bird in the chimney 
and a stone in my bed
when the road's washed out 
they pass the bottle around
and wait in the arms 
of the cold cold ground
cold cold ground
there's a ribbon in the willow 
and a tire swing rope
and a briar patch of berries 
takin over the slope
the cat'll sleep in the mailbox 
and we'll never go to town
til we bury every dream in 
the cold cold ground
cold cold ground
give me a Winchester rifle and a whole box of shells
Blow the roof off the goat barn 
let it roll down the hill
the piano is firewood 
times square is a dream
I find we'll lay down together in the cold cold ground
cold cold ground
cold cold ground
call the cops on the Breedloves 
bring a Bible and a rope
and a whole box of rebel
and a bar of soap
make a pile of trunk tires 
and burn 'em all down
bring a dollar with you baby 
in the cold cold ground
cold cold ground
take a weathervane rooster 
throw rocks at his head
stop talking to the neighbors 
till we all go dead
beware of my temper 
and the dog that I've found
break all the windows in the 
cold cold ground
cold cold ground

# Cold Water

Well I woke up this morning
With the cold water
With the cold water
With the cold water
Woke up this morning
With the cold water
With the cold water
With the cold
Police at the station
and they don't look friendly
Well they don't look friendly
Well they don't look friendly
Police at the station
and they don't look friendly
They don't look friendly well
they don't
Blind or crippled
Sharp or dull
I'm reading the Bible
by a 40 watt bulb
What price freedom
Dirt is my rug
Well I leep like a baby
with the snakes and the bugs
Well the stores are open
but I ain't got no $
I ain't got no $
Stores are open but I
ain't got no $
ain't got no $
Well I ain't
Found an old dog
and he seems to like me
seems to like me
well he seems to like me
Found an old dog and he
seems to like me
seems to like me
well he seems
Seen them fellows
with the card board signs
scrapin up a little $
to buy a bottle of wine
Pregnant women and
the Vietnam vets I say
beggin on the freeway
Bout as hard as it gets
Well I slept in the graveyard
it was cool and still
cool and still
it was cool and still
Slept in the graveyard
it was cool and still
cool and still and it
was cool
Slept all night in the Cedar grove
I was born to ramble
born to rove
Some men are searchin for the
Holy Grail
but there ain't nothin sweeter
than ridin the rails
I look 47 but I'm 24
Well they shooed me away
from here the time before 
Turned there their backs
and they locked their doors
I'm watchin T.V. in
the window of a furniture store
Well I woke up this morning
with the cold water
with the cold water
with the cold water
Woke up this morning
with the cold water

# Come On Up To The House

Well the moon is broken
And the sky is cracked
Come on up to the house
The only things that you can see
Is all that you lack
Come on up to the house
All your cryin don't do no good
Come on up to the house
Come down off the cross
We can use the wood
Come on up to the house
Come on up to the house
Come on up to the house
The world is not my home
I'm just a passin thru
Come on up to the house
There's no light in the tunnel
No irons in the fire
Come on up to the house
And your singin lead soprano
In a junkman's choir
You gotta come on up to the house
Does life seem nasty, brutish and short
Come on up to the house
The seas are stormy 
And you can't find no port
Come on up to the house
There's nothin in the world
That you can do
You gotta come on up to the house
And you been whipped by the forces
That are inside you
Come on up to the house
Well you're high on top
Of your mountain of woe
Come on up to the house
Well you know you should surrender
But you can't let go
You gotta come on up to the house

# Coney Island Baby

Every night she comes
To take me out to dreamland
When I'm with her, I'm the richest
Man in the town
She's a rose, she's the pearl
She's the spin on my world
All the stars make their wishes on her eyes
She's my Coney Island Baby
She's my Coney Island Girl
She's a princess, in a red dress
She's the moon in the mist to me
She's my Coney Island Baby
She's my Coney Island Girl

# Crossroads

Now, George was a good straight boy to begin with,
but there was bad blood in him someway
he got into the magic bullets and 
that leads straight to Devil's work
just like marywanna leads to heroin
You think you can take them bullets and leave 'em, do you?
Just save a few for your bad days. 
well...
Well, now we all have those bad days when we can't hit for shit.
The more of them magics you use, 
the more bad days you have without them
So it comes down to finally
all your days being bad without the bullets
It's magics or nothing.
Time to stop chippying around and kidding yourself,
kid, you're hooked, heavy as lead
And that's where old George found himself.
Out there at the crossroads.
molding the Devil's bullets.
Now a man figures it's his bullets, 
so it'll hit what he wants to hit. 
But it don't always work out that way
You see, some bullets is special for a single aim.
A certain stag, or a certain person
And no matter where you aim, that's where the bullet will end up.
And in the moment of aiming, the gun turns into a dowser's wand,
and point where the bullet wants to go
(George Schmid was moving in a series of convulsive spasms
like someone in an epileptic fit
with his face distorted, and his eyes wild, like a lassoed horse
bracing his legs but something kept pulling him on.
And now he is picking up the skulls and making the circle.)
I guess old George didn't rightly know what he was getting himself into,
the fit was on him and it carried him right to the crossroads.

# Danny Says

Danny says we gotta go
gotta go to Idaho
but we can't go surfing 
cause it's 20 below
sound check is at 5:02
record stores and interviews
I can't wait to be with you tomorrow
baby oh ho oh ho 
we got nowhere to go
and it may sound funny
but it's true
hanging out in 100 b
watching get smart on TV
thinking about you and me and you and me
hanging out in L.A. and there's nowhere to go
it ain't Christmas if there ain't no snow
listening to Sheena on the radio
Oh ho oh ho
sound check is at 5:02
record stores and interviews
I can't wait to be with you tomorrow

# Day After Tomorrow

I got your letter today
And I miss you all so much here
I can't wait to see you all
And I'm counting the days dear
I still believe that there's gold
At the end of the world and I'll
Come home to Illinois on the
Day after tomorrow
Its so hard and its cold here
And I'm tired of taking orders
And I miss old Rockford town
Up by the Wisconsin border
What I miss you won't believe
Shoveling snow and raking leaves
And my plane will touch down
On the day after tomorrow
I close my eyes every nite
And I dream that I can hold you
They fill us full of lies, everyone buys
Bout what it means to
Be a soldier, I still don't
Know how I'm supposed to feel bout
All the blood that's been spilled
Will God on this throne
Get me back home
On the day after tomorrow
You can't deny, the other side
Don't want to die anymore
Then we do, what I'm
Trying to say is don't they pray
To the same God that we do?
And Tell me how does God
Choose, who's prayers does he
Refuse? who turns the wheel
Who rolls the dice, on the
Day after tomorrow
I'm not fighting for justice
I am not fighting for freedom
I am fighting for my life and
Another day in the world here
I just do what I've been told
We're just the gravel on the road
And only the lucky ones come
Home, on the day after tomorrow
And the summer it too
Will fade and with it
Brings the winter's frost dear
And I know we too are made
Of all the things that we have
Lost here, I'll be 21 today
I been saving all my pay
And my plane will touch down
On the day after tomorrow

# Dead And Lovely

She was a middle class girl
In over her head
She thought she could
Stand up in the deep end
He had a bullet proof smile
He had money to burn
She thought she had the moon
In her pocket...
But now she's dead
She's so dead forever
Dead and lovely now
I've always been told to
Remember this
Don't let a fool kiss you
Never marry for love
He was hard to impress
He knew everyone's secrets
He wore her on his arm
Just like jewelry
He never gave but he got
He kept her on a leash
He's not the kind of wheel
You fall asleep at
But now she's dead
She's so dead
Forever dead and
Lovely now
Come closer look deep
You've fallen fast
Just like a plane on a 
Stormy sea
She made up someone to be
She made up somewhere to
Be from
This is one business in the
World where that's no
Problem at all
Every thing that is left
They will only plow under
Soon every one you know
Will be gone
But now she's dead
She's so dead
Forever dead and
Lovely now
I've always been told to 
Remember this
Don't let a kiss fool you
Never marry for love
Now they're all watching
The sea
What's lost can never be broken
Her roots were sweet
But they were shallow
But now she's dead
She's so dead
Forever dead and
Lovely now

# Depot, Depot

Depot, depot, what am I doing here?
Depot, depot, what am I doing here?
I ain't coming, I ain't going
My confusion is showing
And outside the midnight wind is blowing, Sixth Avenue
I'm gonna paint myself blue
At the depot
I watch the taxis pull up and idle
I can't claim title to a single memory
You offered me a key
'Cause opportunity don't knock
Has no tongue as you cannot talk
You're gonna shuffle when you walk
At the depot
This peeping Tom needs a peephole
And an up-tempo song
To move me along
When I find this depot, baby
I'm on a roll just like a pool ball, baby
I'm gonna be there at the roll call maybe
At the depot
Outside the midnight wind is blowing Sixth Avenue
Ah, tell me what is a poor boy to do?
At the depot
I'm on a roll just like a pool ball, baby
I'm gonna be there at the roll call maybe
At the depot
Depot

# Diamonds & Gold

The broken glass 
And the rusty nails 
Where the violets grow
Say goodbye to the railroad
And the mad dogs of summer
And everything that I know
What some men will do here for diamonds
What some men will do here for gold
They're wounded but they just keep on climbin
And they sleep by the side of the road
There's a hole in the ladder 
A fence we can climb
Mad as a hatter
You're thin as a dime
Go out to the meadow 
The hills are agreen
Sing me a rainbow 
Steal me a dream
Small time Napoleons 
Shattered his knees
But he stays in the saddle for Rose
And all his disciples
They shave in the gutter
And gather what's left of his clothes
What some men will do here for diamonds
What some men will do here for gold
They're wounded but they just keep on climbin
And they sleep by the side of the road
There's a hole in the ladder 
A fence we can climb
Mad as a hatter
You're thin as a dime
Go out to the meadow 
The hills are agreen
Sing me a rainbow 
Steal me a dream

# Diamonds on My Windshield

Well, these diamonds on my windshield
And these tears from heaven
Well, I'm pulling into town on the Interstate
I got a steel train in the rain
And the wind bites my cheek through the wing
And it's these late nights and this freeway flying
It always makes me sing
There's a Duster trying to change my tune
He's pulling up fast on the right
Rolling restlessly by a twenty-four hour moon
And a Wisconsin hiker with a cue-ball head
He's wishing he was home in a Wisconsin bed
But there's fifteen feet of snow in the east
Colder than a welldigger's ass
And it's colder than a welldigger's ass
Oceanside, it ends the ride with San Clemente coming up
Those Sunday desperados slip by and cruise with a dry back
And the orange drive-in, the neon billing
And the theatre's filling to the brim
With slave girls and a hot spurn bucket full of sin
Metropolitan area with interchange and connections
Fly-by-nights from Riverside
And out of state plates running a little late
But the sailors jockey for the fast lane
So 101 don't miss it
There's rolling hills and concrete fields
And the broken line's on your mind
The eights go east and the fives go north
And the merging nexus back and forth
You see your sign, cross the line, signaling with a blink
And the radio's gone off the air
Gives you time to think
And you hear the rumble
As you fumble for a cigarette
And blazing through this midnight jungle
Remember someone that you met
And one more block, the engine talks
Whispers 'home at last'
It whispers 'home at last'
Whispers 'home at last'
Whispers 'home at last'
Whispers 'home at last'
And the diamonds on my windshield
And these tears from heaven
Well I'm pulling into town on the Interstate
I got me a steel train in the rain
And the wind bites my cheek through the wing
Late nights and freeway flying
Always makes me sing
It always makes me sing
Hey, look here, Jack
Okay

# Dirt In The Ground

What does it matter, a dream of love 
Or a dream of lies
We're all gonna be the same place 
When we die
Your spirit don't leave knowing 
Your face or your name
And the wind through your bones 
Is all that remains
And we're all gonna be
Just dirt on the ground
The quill from a buzzard 
The blood writes the word
I want to know am I the sky 
Or a bird
'Cause hell is boiling over 
And heaven is full
We're chained to the world 
And we all gotta pull
And we're all gonna be
...just dirt in the ground
Now the killer was smiling 
With nerves made of stone
He climbed the stairs 
And the gallows groaned
And the people's hearts were pounding 
They were throbbing, they were red
As he swung out over the crowd
I heard the hangman said
We're all gonna be...
Just dirt in the ground
Now Cain slew Abel 
He killed him with a stone
The sky cracked open 
And the thunder groaned
Along a river of flesh
Can these dry bones live?
Ask a king or a beggar
And the answer they'll give
Is we're all gonna be
Yea yea
We're all gonna be just

# Dog Door

Well she's as mean as a needle
don't get too close to the heater
she's like a mean shop keeper
who got an extra gun
she about 6'4" and she's a wrecking ball
now go ahead and kiss her
she brought the bad weather with her
she got you coming through the dog door
she got you coming through the dog door
now pigs get fat hogs get slaughtered
you ought to walk away
well you can't but you ought to
climb the rickety stairs
she got the long black hair
but don't sit there
electricity chair
she got you coming through the dog door
she got you coming through the dog door
pitchfork
crowbar
claw hammer
hot tar
she's got ruin in her name 
but she can make it rain
she's a small town jail
and you're starving in the belly of a whale
she got you coming through the dog door
She got you coming through the dog door
pitchfork
crowbar
claw hammer
hot tar

# Don't Go Into That Barn

Don't go into that barn, yea
Don't go into that barn, yea
Black cellophane sky at midnite
Big blue moon with three gold rings
I called Champion to the window
And I pointed up above the trees
That's when I heard my name in a scream
Coming from the woods, out there
I let my dog run off the chain
I locked my door real good with a chair
Don't go into that barn, yea
Don't go into that barn, yea
Everett Lee broke loose again
Its worse than the time before
Cause he's high on potato and tulip wine
Fermented in the muddy rain of course
A drunken wail a drunken train
Blew through the birdless trees
Oh, you're alone alright
Your alone alright
How did I know
How did I know
Don't go into that barn, yea
Don't go into that barn, yea
An old black tree
Scratching up the sky with boney, claw like fingers
A rusty black rake
Digging up the turnips
Of a muddy cold grey sky
Shiny tooth talons
Coiled for grabbing a stranger happening by
And the day went home early
And the sun sank down into 
The muck of a deep dead sky
Don't go into that barn, yea
Don't go into that barn, yea
Back since Saginaw Calinda was born
It's been cotton, soybeans, tobacco and corn
Behind the porticoed house of a long dead farm
They found the falling down timbers of a spooky old barn
Out there like a slave ship upside down
Wrecked beneath the waves of grain
When the river is low
They find old bones and 
When they plow they always
Dig up chains
Don't go into that barn, yea
Don't go into that barn, yea
Did you bury your fire?
Yes sir
Did you cover your tracks?
Yes sir
Did you bring your knife?
Yes sir
Did they see your face? 
No sir
Did the Mom see you?
No sir
Did you go cross the river?
Yes sir
Did you fix your rake?
Yes sir
Did you stay down wind?
Yes sir
Did you hide your gun?
Yes sir
Did you smuggle your rum?
Yes sir
How did I know
How did I know
How did I know
Don't go into that barn, yea
Don't go into that barn, yea
Don't forget that I warned you
Don't go into that barn, yea
Don't go into that barn, yea
Don't go into that barn, yea
No shirt no coat
Put me on a flat boat
Dover, down to Covington
Covington to Louisville
Louisville to Henderson
Henderson to Smithland
Smithland to Memphis
Down to Vicksburg to
Natchez put me on a
Flat boat Dover Dam
To Covington, Covington to
Louisville, Louisville to 
Henderson...

# Down There By The Train

There's a place I know 
where the train goes slow
where the sinners can be washed 
in the blood of the lamb
there's a river by the trestle 
down by Sinner's Grove
down where the Willow and the Dogwood grows
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there where the train
goes slow
you can hear the whistle
you can hear the bell
from the halls of heaven 
to the gates of hell
there's room for the foresaken 
if you're there on time
you'll be washed of all your sins 
and all of your crimes
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there where the train
goes slow
there's a golden moon 
that shines up through the mist
I know that your name 
will be on that list
There's no eye for an eye 
there's no tooth for a tooth
I saw Judas Iscariot carrying John Wilkes Booth
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there where the train
goes slow
so if you live in darkness
if you live in shame
all of the passengers 
will be treated the same
old Humpty Jackson and Gyp the Blood will sing
Charlie Whitman is on the Dillinger's wings
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there where the train
goes slow
if you've lost all your hope 
if you've lost all your faith
I know you will be cared for 
I know you will be safe
all the shameful and all of the whores
even the soldier who pierced the heart of the lord
is down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there where the train
goes slow
well I've never asked forgiveness and 
I've never said a prayer
I've never given of myself 
I've never truly cared
I've hurt the ones who loved me 
I'm still raising cain
I've taken the low road and 
if you've done the same
meet me down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there where the train
goes slow

# Down, Down, Down

He went down down down
and the devil called him by name
he went down down down
hangin' onto the back of a train
he went down down down
this boy went solid down
always chewed tobacco 
and the bathtub gin
always chewed tobacco 
and the bathtub gin
he went down down down
this boy went solid down
he went down

# Downtown

Red Pants and the Sugarman in the Temple Street gloom
drinkin chivas regal in a four dollar room
just another dead soldier in a powder blue light
Sugarman says baby everythings alright
goin downtown down downtown

Montclaire de Havelin doin the St. Vitus dance

all the traffic in the street but it's so hard to think
goin downtown down downtown
goin down downtown
Frankie's wearin lipstick le cardin

Sally's high on crank and hungry for some sweets
fem in the sheets but she's butch in the streets

I want to hold you in my arms I want to push you around
I wanna break your bottle and spill out all your charms

Red Pants and the Sugarman in the Temple Street gloom

Red Pants says to Sugarman said everything's alright

# Downtown Train

Outside another yellow moon
Punched a hole in the nighttime, yes 
I climb through the window and down the street
Shining like a new dime
The downtown trains are full 
With all those Brooklyn girls
They try so hard to break out of their little worlds
You wave your hand and they scatter like crows
They have nothing that will ever capture your heart
They're just thorns without the rose
Be careful of them in the dark
Oh if I was the one
You chose to be your only one
Oh baby can't you hear me now
Will I see you tonight
On a downtown train
Every night its just the same
You leave me lonely, now
I know your window and I know it's late
I know your stairs and your doorway
I walk down your street and past your gate
I stand by the light at the four way
You watch them as they fall
They all have heart attacks
They stay at the carnival 
But they'll never win you back
Will I see you tonight
On a downtown train
Where Every night its just the same
You leave me lonely
Will I see you tonight
On a downtown train
All of my dreams just fall like rain
All upon on a downtown train

# Drunk On The Moon

Tight-slack clad girls on the graveyard shift
'Neath the cement stroll, catch the midnight drift
Cigar chewing Charlie in that newspaper nest
Grifting hot horse tips on who's running the best
And I'm blinded by the neon
Don't try and change my tune
Cause I thought I heard a saxophone
I'm drunk on the moon
And the moon's a silver slipper, it's pouring champagne stars
And Broadway's(8) like a serpent pulling shiny top-down cars
Laramer is teeming with that undulating beat
And some Bonneville is screaming, it's way wilder down the street
And I'm blinded by the neon
Don't try and change my tune
I thought I heard a saxophone
I'm drunk on the moon
Hearts flutter and race, the moon's on the wane
Tarts mutter their dream hopes the night will ordain
Come schemers and dancers, cherry delight
As a Cleveland-bound Greyhound, and it cuts through the night
And I've hawked all my yesterdays
Don't try and change my tune
Cause I thought I heard a saxophone
I'm drunk on the moon

# Earth Died Screaming

Rudy's on the midway 
And Jacob's in the hole
The monkey's on the ladder 
The devil shovels coal
With crows as big as airplanes 
The lion has three heads
And someone will eat the skin that he sheds
And the earth died screaming
While I lay dreaming of you
Well, hell doesn't want you 
And heaven is full
Bring me some water 
Put it in this skull
I walk between the raindrops 
Wait in bug house square
And the army ants
They leave nothin' but the bones
And the earth died screaming
While I lay dreaming of you
There was thunder 
There was lightning
Then the stars went out
And the moon fell from the sky
It rained mackerel
It rained trout
And the great day of wrath has come
And here's mud in your big red eye
The poker's in the fire 
And the locusts take the sky
And the earth died screaming
While I lay dreaming of you

# Eggs And Sausage (In A Cadillac With Susan Michelson)

Nighthawks at the diner of Emma's Forty-Niner
There's a rendezvous of strangers around the coffee urn tonight
All the gypsy hacks and the insomniacs
Now the paper's been read, now the waitress said
'Eggs and sausage and a side of toast
Coffee and a roll, hash browns over easy
Chile in a bowl with burgers and fries
What kind of pie? Yeah...'
It's a graveyard charade, it's a late shift masquerade
And it's two for a quarter, dime for a dance
Woolworth's rhinestone diamond earrings and a sideways glance
Now the register rings, now the waitress sings
Eggs and sausage and a side of toast
Coffee and a roll, hash browns over easy
Chile in a bowl with burgers and fries
What kind of pie? Yeah
Now well, the classified section offers no direction
It's a cold caffeine in a nicotine cloud
Now the touch of your fingers lingers burning in my memory
I've been eighty-sixed from your scheme
Now I'm in a melodramatic nocturnal scene
Now I'm a refugee from a disconcerted affair
Now the lead pipe morning falls, now the waitress calls
'Eggs and sausage, another side of toast
Coffee and a roll, hash browns over easy
Chile in a bowl with burgers and fries
Now what kind of pie?'
À la mode if you will
Just come in and join the crowd
Had some time to kill, yeah
You see, I just come in to join the crowd
Had some time to kill
Just come in to join the crowd
Cause I had some time to kill

# Emotional Weather Report

What we're talking about is late night and early morning low clouds
With a chance of fog, chance of showers into the afternoon
With variable high cloudiness and gusty winds
Gusty winds at times around the corner of Sunset and Alvarado
Yeah, I know, things are tough all over
When the thunder storms start increasing over the
Southeast and south central portions of my apartment, I get upset
And a line of thunderstorms was developing in the early morning hours
Ahead of a slow moving cold front, cold-blooded
With tornado watches issued shortly before noon Sunday
For the areas including the western region of my mental health
And the northern portion of my ability to deal rationally
With my disconcerted precarious emotional situation
It's cold out there
Colder than the ticket taker's smile at the Ivar Theatre, on Saturday night
Flash flood watches cover the southern portion of my disposition, yeah
There was no severe weather well into the afternoon
Except for kind of a lone gust of wind in the bedroom
A high pressure zone covering the eastern portion of a small
Suburban community with a 1034 millibar high pressure zone
And a weak pressure ridge extending from my eyes down to my cheeks
'Cause since you left me baby and put the vice grips on my mental health
Well, the extended outlook for an indefinite period of time
Until you come back to me, baby, is high tonight, low tomorrow
And precipitation is expected
That wraps up the weather for this evening.
Now back to the eleven o'clock blues.
Doctor George Fishbeck ain't got nothing on me!

# Everything Goes to Hell

Why be sweet, why be careful, why be kind?
A man has only one thing on his mind
Why ask politely, why go lightly, why say please?
They only want to get you on your knees
There are a few things I never could believe
A woman when she weeps
A merchant when he swears
A thief who says he'll pay
A lawyer when he cares
A snake when he is sleeping
A drunkard when he prays
I don't believe you go to heaven when you're good
Everything goes to hell, anyway...
Laissez-faire mi amour, ce la vie
Shall I return to shore or swim back out to sea?
The world don't care what a soldier does in town
It's all hanging in the windows by the pound
There are few things I never could believe...
A woman when she weeps
A merchant when he swears
A thief who says he'll pay
A lawyer when he cares
A snake when he is sleeping
A drunkard when he prays
I don't believe you go to heaven when you're good
Everything goes to hell, anyway...
I only want to hear your purr and to hear you moan
There is another man who brings the money home
I don't want dishes in the sink
Please don't tell me what you feel or 
what you think
There are few things I never could believe...

# Everything You Can Think

Everything you can think of is true
Before the ocean was blue
We were lost in a flood
Run red with you blood
Nigerian skeleton crew
Everything you can think of is true
The dish ran away with a spoon
Dig deep in your heart for that little red glow
We're decomposing as we go
Everything you can think of is true
And fishes make wishes on you
We're fighting our way up dreamland's spine
With red flamingos and expensive wine
Everything you can think of is true
The baby's asleep in your shoe
Your teeth are buildings with yellow doors
Your eyes are fish on a creamy shore

# Eyeball Kid

Well Zenora Bariella and Coriander Pyle they had sixteen children in the usual style
They had a curio museum and they had no guile
All they ever wanted was a show biz child
So on the 7th of Dec 1949 they got whatthey'd been wishing for all of the time
He grew up in a trailer by the time he was 9 he rolled off to join  the circus telling fortunes on the side
Hail Hail, the Eyeball kid
Well the 1st time I saw him was a Saigon jail 
Cost me 27 dollars just to go his bail
I said your name will be in lights and that's no doubt
But you got to have a manager that's what it's all about
People would point
People would stare
I'll always be here to protect you and to cut down on the glare
I know you can't speak
I know you can't sign
So cry right here on the dotted line
Hail Hail, the Eyeball kid
Well he was born with out a body
Not even a brow
I made the kid a promise
I made the kid a vow
He's not conventionally handsome
He'll never be tall
He said "all you got to do is book me into Carnegie Hall"
Hail Hail, the Eyeball kid
He's just a little bitty thing
He's just a little guy but women go crazy for the big blue eye
They say how does he dream? How does he think
When he can't ever speak and he can't ever blink?
I said Hail Hail, the Eyeball kid
Hail Hail, the Eyeball kid
Give it up and throw me down a couple of quid
Everybody wants to see the Eyeball kid
How does he dream 
How does he think 
When he can't even speak and he can't even blink
We are all lost in the wilderness we're as blind as can be
He came down to teach us how to really see
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
So give it up and throw me down a couple of quid
Everybody wants to see the Eyeball kid
Eyeball kid
Eyeball kid

# Face To The Highway

I’m going away
I’m going away

The cradle wants a baby
Kitchen wants a pan
The heart wants a certain kind of lover if it can

Ocean wants a sailor
Gun wants a hand
money wants a spender
And the road wants a man

I turned my face to the highway
And I turn my back on you

Devil wants a sinner
Sky wants a bird
Table wants the dinner
Lips want a word

Glass wants the wine
Fist wants to hurt
Clock wants the time
And the shovel wants to work

I turned my face to the highway
And I turn my back on you

I’m going away
I’m going away

Coal wants a miner
Soldier takes a stand
The walls of the prison
Want a solitary man
The window wants a curtain
The plow wants the land
Diamond ring wants to
Fit upon the finger
Of her hand

I turned my face to the highway
And I turned my back on you

I’m going away
I’m going away
I’m going away

# The Fall Of Troy

It's the same with men as with horses and dogs
nothing wants to die
Evelyn James they killed in a game
with guns too big for their hands
just off St. Charles in no man's land
you'll have to find your own way home boys
you'll have to find your own way home

the oldest was Troy 
an eighteen year old boy
shot dead in March in a robbery
his brother started out to hell and to ruin
Troy's killer was never caught they say
young Nick he just went bad that day
now he'll have to find his own way home boys
he'll have to find his own way home

why cook dinner
why make my bed
why come home at all
out the door and through the woods
there's a world where nothing grows

it's hard to say grace and to sit in the place
of someone missing at the table
mom's hair sprayed tight and her face in her hands
watching TV for answers to me
after all she's only human
she's trying to find her own way home boys
she's trying to find her own way home

my legs ache
my heart is sore
the well is full of pennies

# Falling Down

I've come 500 miles 
Just to see your halo
Come from St. Petersburg 
Scarlett and me
When I open my eyes 
I was blind as can be
And to give a man luck 
He must fall in the sea
And she wants you to steal and get caught
For she loves you for all that you are not
When you're falling down
Falling down
When you're falling down
Falling down falling down

You forget all the roses 
Don't come around on Sunday
She's not gonna choose you 
For standing so tall
Go on take a swig of that poison 
And like it
And now don't ask for silverware 
Don't ask for nothing
Go on and put your ear to the ground
You know you'll be hearing that sound 
Falling down
You're falling down falling down
Falling down falling down
Falling down

When you're falling down 
Falling down falling down

Go on down see that wrecking ball 
Come swing in on her now
Everyone knew that hotel was a goner
They broke all the windows 
And took all the door knobs
And they hauled it away 
In a couple of days
Now someone yelled timber
Take off your hat
We all look smaller 
Down here on the ground
When you're falling down 
Falling down falling down
Falling down falling down
Falling down

Someone's falling down 
Falling down falling down
Falling down falling down
Falling down

# Fannin Street
There's a crooked street in Houston town
it's a well worn path I've followed down
now there's ruin in my name 
I wish I never got off the train
I wished I'd listened to the words you said

don't go down to Fannin Street
don't go down to Fannin Street
don't go down to Fannin Street
oh yeah
you'll be lost and never found
you can never turn around

don't go down to Fannin Street

once I held you in my arms I was sure
till I took that silent step through the gilded door
but the desire to have much more all the glitter and the roar
now I know that this is where the sidewalk ends

don't go down to Fannin Street
don't go down to Fannin Street
don't go down to Fannin Street
you'll be lost and never found
you can never turn around

don't go down to Fannin Street

when I was young I thought only of getting out
I said good-bye to my street 
good-bye to my house
give a man gin give a man cards 
give an inch he takes a yard
and I rue the day that I stepped off this train

don't go down to Fannin Street
don't go down to Fannin Street
don't go down to Fannin Street
oh yeah
you'll be lost and never found
you can never turn around

# Filipino Box Spring Hog

Well I hung on to Mary's stump
I danced with a soldier's glee
With a rum soaked crook
And a big fat laugh
I spent my last dollar on thee
I saw Bill Bones, gave him a yell
Kehoe spiked the nog
With a chain link fence
And a scrap iron jaw
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring hog
Spider rolled in from
Hollister Burn
With a one-eyed stolen Mare
Donned himself with chicken fat
Sawin on a jaw bone violin there
Kathleen was sittin down
In little reds recovery room
In her criminal underwear bra
I was naked to the waist
With my fierce black hound
And I'm cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog

Dig a big pit in a dirt alley road
Fill it with madrone and bay
Stinks like hell
And the neighbors complain
Don't give a hoot what they say
Slap that hog
Gotta roll em over twice
Baste him with a sweeping broom
You gotta swat them flies
And chain up the dogs
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog

Rattle snake piccata with grapes and figs
Old brown Betty with a yellow wig
Tain't the mince meat filagree
And it ain't the turkey neck stew
And it ain't them bruleed
Okra seeds though she
Made them especially for you
Worse won a prize for her
Bottom black pie
The beans got to thrown to the dogs
Jaheseus Christ I can always
Make room when they're
Cookin up a Filipino box Spring Hog
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog

# First Kiss

She drove a big old Lincoln 
with suicide doors
and a sewing machine in the back
and a light bulb that looked like 
an alligator egg
was mounted up front on the hood

and she had an Easter bonnet that had been signed 
by Tennessee Ernie Ford
and she always had saw dust in her hair
and she cut two holes in the back of her dress
and she had these scapular wings
that were covered with feathers and electrical tape
and when she got good and drunk
she would sing about Elkheart, Indiana
where the wind is strong 
and folks mind their own business

and she had at least a hundred old baseballs 
that she'd taken from kids
and she collected bones of all kinds
and she lived in a trailer under a bridge
and she made her own whiskey and gave cigarettes to kids
and she'd been struck by lightning seven or eight times
and she hated the mention of rain

and she made up her own language
and she wore rubber boots
and she could fix anything with string
and her lips were like cherries
and she was stronger than any man
and she smelled like gasoline and root beer fizz
and she put mud on a bee sting 
I got at the creek
and she gave me 
my very first kiss
and she gave me 
my very first kiss

talking 'bout my little Kathleen
she's just a fine young thing
someday she'll wear my ring
my little Kathleen

# Fish & Bird

They bought a round for the sailor
And they heard his tale
Of a world that was so far away
And a song that we'd never heard
A song of a little bird
That fell in love with a whale

He said: you cannot live in the ocean
And she said to him: You never can live in the sky
But the ocean is filled with tears
And the sea turns into a mirror
And there's a whale in the moon when it's clear
And a bird on the tide

Please don't cry
Let me dry
Your eyes

So tell me that you will wait for me
Hold me in your arms
I promise we never will part
I'll never sail back to the time
But I'll always pretend you're mine
Though I know that we both must part
You can live in my heart

# Fish In The Jailhouse

Peoria Johnson told Dudlow Joe
I can break out of any old jail you know
the bars are iron the walls are stone
all I need me is an old fish bone

they're serving fish in the jailhouse tonight
oh boy
they're serving fish in the jailhouse tonight

corvina opal eye hammerhead shark
steelhead salmon or a mud bank carp
sand me one side dull 
whittle the other side sharp
by Saturday night I'll be in central park

they're serving fish in the jailhouse tonight
oh boy
They're serving fish in the jailhouse tonight

ask Little Son Jackson or the 44. Kid
or Whitfield Faraday what I did
from Yazoo city up to Rollin Fork
from Natchez to Kinosha 
from New Dime to New York

they're serving fish in the jailhouse tonight
oh boy
They're serving fish in the jailhouse tonight

gimme a nice totuava or a chicken of the sea
I'm gonna fashion me a fishbone skeleton key
tell Scullion Childs I won't be late
you can bet your freedom I'm gonna clean my plate

fish in the jailhouse tonight
they're serving fish in the jailhouse tonight
they're serving fish in the jailhouse
fish in the jailhouse tonight
serving fish in the jailhouse tonight
serving fish in the jailhouse tonight
all right

# Flash Pan Hunter

The flash pan hunter sways with the wind
His rifle is the sound of the morning
Each sulfurous bullet way have its own wit
Each cartridge comes with a warning
Beware of elaborate telescopic meats
They will find their way back to the forest

For Wilhelm can't wait 
To be Peg Leg's crown
As the briar is strangling 
The rose back down

His back shall be my slender new branch
It will sway and bend in the breeze
As the Devil does his Polka 
With a hatchet in his hand
As a sniper in the branches of the trees
As the vulture flutters down
As the snake sheds his dove
Wilhelm's cutting off his fingers 
So they'll fit into his glove

For Wilhelm can't wait 
To be Peg Leg's crown
As the briar is strangling 
The rose back down

# Flowers Grave

Someday the silver moon and I
Will go to Dreamland
I will close my eyes
And wake up there in Dreamland
But tell me who will put flowers
On a flower's grave
Who will say a prayer

Will I meet a China rose there
In Dreamland
Or does love lie bleeding
In Dreamland
Are these days gone forever and always

If we are to die tonight
Is there moonlight up ahead
And if we are to die tonight
Another rose will bloom

For a faded rose
Will I be the one that you save
I love when it showers
But no one puts flowers
On a flower's grave

As one rose dies another blooms
It's always been that way
I remember the showers
But no one puts flowers
On a flower's grave

# Foreign Affair

When traveling abroad in the continental style
It's my belief one must attempt to be discreet
And subsequently bear in mind your transient position
Allows you a perspective that's unique

And though you'll find your itinerary a blessing and a curse
Your wanderlust won't let you settle down
And you'll wonder how you ever fathomed that you'd be content
To stay within the city limits of a small mid western town

Most vagabonds I knowed don't ever want to find the culprit
That remains the object of their long relentless quest
The obsession's in the chasing and not the apprehending
The pursuit you see and never the arrest

Without fear of contradiction bon voyage is always hollered
In conjunction with a handkerchief from shore
By a girl who drives a Rambler and furthermore is overly concerned
That she won't see him anymore

Planes and trains and boats and buses characteristically
Evoke a common attitude of blue
Unless you have a suitcase and a ticket and a passport
And the cargo that they're carrying is you

A foreign affair juxtaposed with a stateside
And domestically approved romantic fancy
Is mysteriously attractive due to circumstances
Knowing it will only be parlayed into a memory

# Frank's Wild Years

Well Frank settled down in the Valley
and he hung his wild years 
on a nail that he drove through 
his wife's forehead
he sold used office furniture 
out there on San Fernando Road
and assumed a $30,000 loan 
at 15 _ % and put a down payment 
on a little two bedroom place
his wife was a spent piece of used jet trash
made good bloody marys
kept her mouth shut most of the time
had a little Chihuahua named Carlos
that had some kind of skin disease
and was totally blind. They had a thoroughly modern kitchen
self-cleaning oven (the whole bit)
Frank drove a little sedan
they were so happy

One night Frank was on his way home 
from work, stopped at the liquor store,
picked up a couple Mickey's Big Mouths
drank 'em in the car on his way 
to the Shell station, he got a gallon of 
gas in a can, drove home, doused 
everything in the house, torched it,
parked across the street, laughing
watching it burn, all Halloween 
orange and chimney red then 
Frank put on a top forty station
got on the Hollywood Freeway
headed North

Never could stand that dog

# Franks Theme

Dream away the tears in your eyes
Dream away your sorrows
Dream away all your goodbyes
Dream away tomorrow
I promise when the sun comes up
I promise I'll be true
and just like before the band starts to play
they always play your favorite tune
and dream away when everyone's gone
dream away your grey skies too
dream away and nothing is wrong
dreams have wishes that are waiting for you
and up ahead the road is turning
turning for you and me
and just like before 
the band starts to play
now there's that twinkle in your eye
and dream away

# Fumblin' With The Blues

Friday left me fumbling with the blues
And it's hard to win when you always lose
Because the nightspots spend your spirit
Beat your head against the wall
Two dead ends and you've still got to choose

You know the bartenders they all know my name
And they catch me when I'm pulling up lame
And I'm a pool-shooting-shimmy-shyster shaking my head
When I should be living clean instead

You know the ladies I've been seeing off and on
Well they spend your love and then they're gone
You can't be lovin' someone who is savage and cruel
Take your love and then they leave on out of town, no they do

Well now falling in love is such a breeze
But its standing up that's so hard for me
I wanna squeeze you but I'm scared to death I'd break your back
You know your perfume well it won't let me be

And you know the bartenders all know my name
And they catch me when I'm pulling up lame
And I'm a pool-shooting-shimmy-shyster shaking my head
When I should be living clean instead

Well, come on baby let your love light shine
Gotta bury me inside of your fire
Because your eyes are enough to blind me
You're like a-looking at the sun
You gotta whisper tell me I'm the one
Come on and whisper tell me I'm the one
Gotta whisper tell me I'm the one
Come on and whisper tell me I'm the one

# Georgia Lee

Cold was the night, hard was the ground
They found her in a small grove of trees
Lonesome was the place where Georgia was found. 
She's too young to be out on the street

Why wasn't God watching?
Why wasn't God listening?
Why wasn't God there for 
Georgia Lee?

Ida said she couldn't keep Georgia from dropping out of school
I was doing the best that I could but she kept runnin away from this world these children are so hard to raise good

Why wasn't God watching?
Why wasn't God listening?
Why wasn't God there for 
Georgia Lee?

Close your eyes and count to ten
I will go and hide but then be sure to find me. 
I want you to find me and we'll play all over
We will play all over again.

There's a toad in the witch grass
There's a crow in the corn
Wild flowers on a cross by the road
and somewhere a baby is crying
for her mom
As the hills turn from green back 
to gold

Why wasn't God watching?
Why wasn't God listening?
Why wasn't God there for 
Georgia Lee?

# Get Behind The Mule

Molly be damned smote Jimmy the Harp
With a horrid little pistol and a lariat
she's goin to the bottom
and she's goin down the drain
Said she wasn't big enough to carry it

She got to get behind the Mule
in the morning and plow
She got to get behind the Mule
in the morning and plow
She got to get behind the Mule
in the morning and plow
She got to get behind the Mule
in the morning and plow

Choppity chop goes the axe in the woods
You gotta meet me by the fall down tree
Shovel of dirt upon a coffin lid
and I know they'll come lookin for me boys
and I know they'll come a-lookin for me

Got to get behind the Mule
in the morning and plow
Got to get behind the Mule 
in the morning and plow
Got to get behind the Mule
in the morning and plow
Got to get behind the Mule
in the morning and plow

Big Jack Earl was 8'1'
He stood in the road and he cried
He couldn't make her love him
Couldn't make her stay
but tell the good Lord that he tried
(Chorus)
Dusty trail from Atchison to Placerville
On the wreck of the Weaverville stage
Beaula fired on Beatty for a lemonade
I was stirring my brandy with a nail boys
Stirring my brandy with a nail
(Chorus)
Well the rampaging sons of the widow James
Jack the cutter and the pock marked kid
Had to stand naked at the bottom
Of the cross
And tell the good lord what they did
Tell the good lord what they did
(Chorus)
Punctuated birds on the power line
In a Studebaker with the Birdie Joe Hoaks
I'm diggin all the way to China
With a silver spoon
While the hangman fumbles with the noose, boys
The hangman fumbles with the noose
(Chorus)
Pin your ear to the wisdom post
Pin your eye to the line
Never let the weeds get higher
than the garden
Always keep a sapphire in your mind
Always keep a diamond in your mind
(Chorus)

# Get Lost

I don’t want to feel all cooped up
I feel like I’m on a chain
I got my ride all souped up
We’re never coming back again
Time it don’t mean nothing
Money means even less
Don’t bring nothin baby
You’re better then all the rest
I wanna go get lost
I wanna go get lost
I wanna go get lost

When you wear that real tight sweater
You know I can’t resist
It’s been that way forever baby
Ever since we kissed
Roll down all the windows
Turn up Wolfman Jack
Please, please love me tender
Ain’t nothin wrong with that
Let’s go get lost
I wanna go get lost
I wanna go get lost
I wanna go get lost

Whatever that they told you about me
Well all of it’s true
You’re never gonna be with out me baby
I’m never gonna be without you
Top it off, fill it with high test
Think about it what cha gonna tell your boss?
And get lost
I just wanna get lost
All night long…

# The Ghosts Of Saturday Night (After Hours At Napoleone's Pizza House)

A cab combs the snake, tryin' to rake in that last night's fare
And a solitary sailor, who spends the facts of his life like small change on strangers
Paws his inside peacoat pocket for a welcome twenty-five cents
And the last bent butt from a package of Kents
As he dreams of a waitress with Maxwell House eyes
And marmalade thighs with scrambled yellow hair
Her rhinestone-studded moniker says "Irene"
As she wipes the wisps of dishwater blonde from her eyes

And the Texaco beacon burns on
The steel-belted attendant with a ring and valve special crying
'Fill 'er up and check that oil
You know it could be your distributor and it could be your coil'

The early morning final edition is on the stands
And the town crier is crying there with nickels in his hands
Pigs in a blanket, sixty-nine cents
Eggs, roll 'em over, and a package of Kents
Adam and Eve on a log, you can sink 'em down straight
Hash browns, hash browns, you know I can't be late

And the early dawn cracks out a carpet of diamonds
Across a cash crop car lot, filled with twilight Coupe Devilles
Leaving the town in the keeping
Of the one who is sweeping
Up the ghosts of Saturday night

# Gin Soaked Boy

I got a belly full of you and that Leavenworth stuff now I'm gonna get out 
And I'm gonna get tough you been lying to me 
How could you crawl so low with some gin-soaked boy that you don't know

I come home last night 
full a fifth of Old Crow
You said you goin' to your Ma's 
but where the hell did you go
you went and slipped out nights 
you didn't think that I'd know
with some gin-soaked boy 
that you don't know

Well I would bet you as far 
as Oklahoma by now
the dogs are barking out back 
and you're knittin' your brow
well, I'm on your tail I sussed your M.O.
from some gin-soaked boy 
that you don't know

# God's Away On Business

I'd sell your heart to the junkman baby
For a buck, for a buck
If you're looking for someone to pull you 
out of that ditch
You're out of luck, you're out of luck

The ship is sinking
The ship is sinking
The ship is sinking

There's leak, there's a leak, in the boiler room
The poor, the lame, the blind
Who are the ones that we kept in charge
Killers, thieves, and lawyers

God's Away, God's away
God's away on Business. Business.
God's Away, God's Away
God's Away on Business. Business.

Digging up the dead with a shovel and a pick
It's a job, it's a job
Bloody moon rising with a plague and a flood
Join the mob, join the mob
It's all over, It's all over, It's all over

There's a leak, there's a leak, in the boiler room
The poor, the lame, the blind
Who are the ones that we kept in charge?
Killers, thieves, and lawyers
God's away, God's away, God's away
On Business. Business.
God's away, God's away, God's away
On Business.

Goddamn there's always such a big temptation
To be good, To be good
There's always free cheddar in a mousetrap, baby
It's a deal, it's a deal
God's away, God's away, God's away
On Business. Business.

I narrow my eyes like a coin slot baby,
Let her ring, let her ring

God's Away, God's Away
God's Away on Business.
Business...

# Goin' Out West

Well I'm goin' out west 
Where the wind blows tall
'Cause Tony Franciosa 
Used to date my ma
They got some money out there
They're giving it away
I'm gonna do what I want 
And I'm gonna get paid
Do what I want 
And I'm gonna get paid

Little brown sausages 
Lying in the sand
I ain't no extra baby 
I'm a leading man
Well, my parole officer 
Will be proud of me
With my Olds 88 
And the devil on a leash

I know karate, Voodoo too
I'm gonna make myself available to you
I don't need no make up
I got real scars
I got hair on my chest
I look good without a shirt

Well I don't lose my composure
In a high speed chase
Well my friends think I'm ugly
I got a masculine face
I got some dragstrip courage
I can really drive a bed
I'm gonna change my name to Hannibal
Or maybe just Rex

I know karate, Voodoo too
I'm gonna make myself available to you
I don't need no make up
I got real scars
I got hair on my chest
I look good without a shirt

I'm gonna drive all night
Take some speed
I'm gonna wait for the sun 
To shine down on me
I cut a hole in my roof
The shape of a heart
And I'm goin' out west 
Where they'll appreciate me
Goin' out west 
Goin' out west

# Good Old World (Waltz)

When I was a boy, 
the moon was a pearl
the sun a yellow gold.
But when I was a man, 
the wind blew cold
the hills were upside down
but now that I have gone from here
there's no place I'd rather be
than to float my chances on the tide
Back in the good old world

On October's last, 
I'll fly back home
rolling down winding way
And all I've got's a pocket full
of flowers on my grave
But now summer is gone 
I remember it best
Back in the good old world
I remember when, 
she held my hand
and we walked home alone in the rain
how pretty her mouth, how soft her hair
nothing can be the same
and there's a rose upon her breast
where I long to lay my head
and her hair was so yellow 
and the wine was so red
Back in the good old world

# Goodnight Irene

Irene good night 
Irene Irene good night
good night Irene 
good night Irene
I'll get you 
in my dreams

last Saturday night I got married
me and my wife settled down
now me and my wife are parted
I'm gonna take me a little stroll uptown

Irene good night 
Irene Irene good night
good night Irene 
good night Irene
I'll get you 
in my dreams

sometimes I live in the country
sometimes I live in town
sometimes I take a great notion
to jump in the river and drown

Irene good night 
Irene Irene good night
good night Irene 
good night Irene
I'll get you 
in my dreams

I love Irene god knows I do
I'll love her till the sea runs dry
if she ever loves another
someone'll take morphine and die

Irene good night 
Irene Irene good night
good night Irene 
good night Irene
I'll get you 
in my dreams

stop your rambling 
stop your gambling
stop staying out late at night
go home to your wife and your family
sit down by the fire light

Irene good night 
Irene Irene good night
good night Irene 
good night Irene
I'll get you 
in my dreams

Irene good night 
Irene Irene good night
good night Irene 
good night Irene
I'll get you 
in my dreams

# Grapefruit Moon

One, two, three, four

Grapefruit moon, one star shining
Shining down on me
Heard that tune, and now I'm pining
Honey, can't you see?
'Cause every time I hear that melody
Something breaks inside
And the grapefruit moon, one star shining
Can't turn back the tide

Never had no destinations
Could not get across
You became my inspiration
Oh, but what a cost
And every time I hear that melody
Something breaks inside
And the grapefruit moon, one star shining
Is more than I can hide

Now I'm smoking cigarettes
And I strive for purity
And I slip just like the stars
Into obscurity
And every time I hear that melody
Puts me up a tree
And the grapefruit moon, one star shining
Is all that I can see

# Green Grass

Lay your head where
My heart used to be
Hold the earth above me
Lay down in the green grass
Remember when you loved me

Come closer don't be shy
Stand beneath a rainy sky
The moon is over the rise
Think of me as a train goes by
Clear the thistles and brambles
Whistle didn't he ramble
Now there's a bubble of me
And its floating in thee
Stand in the shade of me
Things are now made of me
The weather vane will say
It smells like rain today
God took the stars and he
Tossed 'em can't tell
The birds from the blossoms
You'll never be free of me
He'll make a tree from me
Don't say good bye to me
Describe the sky to me
And if the sky falls mark
My words – we'll catch mocking birds

Lay your head where
My heart used to be
Hold the earth above me
Lay down in the green grass
Remember when you loved me

# Gun Street Girl

Falling James in the Tahoe mud
Stick around to tell us all the tale
He fell in love with a Gun Street girl and
Now he's dancing in the Birmingham jail
Dancing in the Birmingham jail

Took a 100 dollars off a Slaughterhouse Joe
Bought a bran' new Michigan 20 gauge
Got all liquored up on that roadhouse corn,
Blew a hole in the hood of a yellow corvette
Blew a hole in the hood of a yellow corvette
Bought a second hand Nova from a Cuban Chinese
Dyed his hair in the bathroom of a Texaco
With a pawnshop radio, quarter past 4
Well he left Waukegan at the slammin' of the door
He left Waukegan at the slammin' of the door

I said, John, John he's long gone
Gone to Indiana 
Ain't never coming home
I said John, John he's long gone
Gone to Indiana 
Ain't never coming home

Sitting in a sycamore in St. John's Wood
Soakin' day old bread in kerosene
He was blue as a robin's egg brown as a hog
Stayin' out of circulation till the dogs get tired
Stayin' out of circulation till the dogs get tired

Shadow fixed the toilet with an old trombone
He never got up in the morning on a Saturday
Sittin' by the Erie with a bull whipped dog
Tellin' everyone he saw
They went thatta way
Tellin' everyone he saw
They went thatta way

Now the rain's like gravel on an old tin roof
And the Burlington Northern's pullin' out of the world
With a head full of bourbon and a dream in the straw
And a Gun Street Girl was the cause of it all
A Gun Street girl was the cause of it all

Riding in the shadow by the St. Joe Ridge
He heard the click clack tappin' of a blind man's cane
Pullin' into Baker on a New Year's Eve
With one eye on the pistol and the other on the door
With one eye on the pistol and the other on the door

Miss Charlotte took her satchel down to King Fish Row
And she smuggled in a bran' new pair of alligator shoes
With her fireman's raincoat and her long yellow hair, well
They tied her to a tree with a skinny millionaire
They tied her to a tree with a skinny millionaire

I said, John, John he's long gone
Gone to Indiana 
Ain't never coming home
I said John, John he's long gone
Gone to Indiana 
Ain't never coming home
Bangin' on a table with an old tin cup
Sing I'll never kiss a Gun Street Girl again
I'll never kiss a Gun Street Girl again

I said, John, John he's long gone
Gone to Indiana 
Ain't never coming home
I said John, John he's long gone
Gone to Indiana 
Ain't never coming home

# The Heart Of A Saturday Night

Well, you gassed her up, behind the wheel
With your arm around your sweet one in your Oldsmobile
Barreling down the boulevard
You're looking for the heart of Saturday night

And you got paid on Friday, your pockets are jingling
Then you see the lights and you get all tingling
Cause you're cruising with a six
You're looking for the heart of Saturday night

Then you comb your hair, you shave your face
Trying to wipe out every trace
Of all the other days in the week
You know that this'll be the Saturday you're reaching your peak

Stopping on the red, you're going on the green
Cause tonight will be like nothing you've ever seen
And you're barreling down the boulevard
You're looking for the heart of Saturday night

Tell me, is it the crack of the pool balls, neon buzzing
Telephone's ringing, it's your second cousin
Is it the barmaid that's smiling from the corner of her eye
Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye

Makes it kind of quiver down in the core
Cause you're dreaming of them Saturdays that came before
And now you're stumbling
You're stumbling onto the heart of Saturday night

You gassed her up and you're behind the wheel
With your arm around your sweet one in your Oldsmobile
Barreling down the boulevard
You're looking for the heart of Saturday night

Is it the crack of the pool balls, neon buzzing
Telephone's ringing, it's your second cousin
And the barmaid is smiling from the corner of her eye
Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye

Makes it kind of special down in the core
And you're dreaming of them Saturdays that came before
It's found you stumbling
Stumbling onto the heart of Saturday night

And you're stumbling
Stumbling onto the heart of Saturday night

# Hell Broke Luce

I had a good home but I left
I had a good home but I left, right, left
That big fucking bomb made me deaf, deaf
A Humvee mechanic put his Kevlar on wrong
I guarantee you’ll meet up with a suicide bomb
Hell broke luce
Hell broke luce

Big fucking ditches in the middle of the road
You pay a hundred dollars just for fillin’ in the hole
Listen to the general every goddamn word
How many ways can you polish up a turd
Left, right, left, left, right
Left, right
Hell broke luce
Hell broke luce
Hell broke luce

How is it that the only ones responsible for making this mess
Got their sorry asses stapled to a goddamn desk
Hell broke luce
Hell broke luce
Left, right, left

What did you do before the war?
I was a chef, I was a chef
What was your name?
It was Geoff, Geoff
I lost my buddy and I wept, wept
I come down from the meth
So I slept, slept
I had a good home but I left, left
Pantsed at the wind for a joke
I pranced right in with the dope
Glanced at her shin she said nope
Left, right, left

Nimrod Bodfish have you any wool
Get me another body bag the body bag’s full
My face was scorched, scorched
I miss my home I miss my porch, porch
Left, right, left

Can I go home in March? March
My stanch was a chin full of soap
That rancid dinner with the pope
Left, right, left

Kelly Presutto got his thumbs blown off
Sergio’s developing a real bad cough
Sergio’s developing a real bad cough
Hell broke luce
Hell broke luce
Hell broke luce

Boom went his head away
And boom went Valerie
What the hell was it that the president said?
Give him a beautiful parade instead
Left, right, left

When I was over here I never got to vote
I left my arm in my coat
My mom she died and never wrote
We sat by the fire and ate a goat
Just before he died he had a toke
Now I’m home and I’m blind
And I’m broke
What is next

# Hoist That Rag

Well I learned the trade
From Piggy Knowles and
Sing Sing Tommy Shay Boys
god used me as hammer boys
To beat his weary drum today

Hoist that rag
Hoist that rag

The sun is up the world is flat
Damn good address for a rat
The smell of blood
The drone of flies
You know what to do if
The baby cries

Hoist that rag
Hoist that rag

Well we stick our fingers in
The ground, heave and 
Turn the world around
Smoke is blacking out the sun
At night I pray and clean my gun
The cracked bell rings as
The ghost bird sings and the gods
Go begging here
So just open fire
As you hit the shore
All is fair in love
And war

Hoist that rag
Hoist that rag
Hoist that rag
Hoist that rag

# Hold On

They hung a sign up in our town
"if you live it up, you won't
live it down"
So, she left Monte Rio, son
just like a bullet leaves a gun
With charcoal eyes and Monroe hips
she went and took that California trip
Well, the moon was gold, her
hair like wind
She said don't look back just
come on Jim
(Chorus)
Oh you got to
Hold on, Hold on
You got to hold on
Take my hand, I'm standing right here
You gotta hold on

Well, he gave her a dimestore watch
and a ring made from a spoon
Everyone is looking for someone to blame
but you share my bed, you share my name
Well, go ahead and call the cops
you don't meet nice girls in coffee shops
She said baby, I still love you
Sometimes there's nothin left to do

Oh you got to
Hold on, hold on
You got to hold on
Take my hand, I'm standing right here, you got to
just hold on

Well, God bless your crooked little heart
St. Louis got the best of me
I miss your broken-china voice
How I wish you were still
here with me

Well, you build it up, you wreck it down
you burn your mansion to the ground
When there's nothing left to keep you here, when
you're falling behind in this
big blue world

Oh you got to
Hold on, hold on
You got to hold on
Take my hand, I'm standing right here
You got to hold on

Down by the Riverside motel, 
it's 10 below and falling 
by a 99 cent store she closed her eyes 
and started swaying 
but it's so hard to dance that way 
when it's cold and there's no music
well your old hometown is so far away
but, inside your head there's a record
that's playing, a song called

Hold on, hold on 
You really got to hold on 
Take my hand, I'm standing right here
and just hold on.

# Home I'll Never Be

Well I left New York 
in nineteen forty-nine
to go across the country 
without a dad blamed dime
Montana in the cold cold fall
I found my father in a gambling hall

father father 
where have you been
I've been out in the world 
since I was only ten
father father 
where have you been
I've been out in the world 
since I was only ten

don't worry about me
about to die of pleurisy
cross the Mississippi
cross the Tennessee
cross the Niagara
home I'll never be
home in old Medora
home in ol' Truckee
Apalachicola
home I'll never be

for better or for worse
or thick and thin
I've been married to the little woman
god he loves me 
like I love him
I want you to do 
just the same for him
well the worms eat away
but don't worry
watch the wind

so I left Montana 
on an old freight train
the night my father died 
in the cold cold rain

rode to Opelousas 
rode to Wounded Knee
rode to Ogallala
home I'll never be
rode to Oklahoma 
rode to El Cajon
rode to old Tehatchapi
rode to San Antone

hey hey

rode to Opelousas 
rode to Wounded Knee
rode to Ogallala
home I'll never be
rode to Oklahoma 
rode to El Cajon
rode to old Tehatchapi
rode to San Antone

home I'll never be

# House Where Nobody Lives

There's a house on my block
that's abandoned and cold
Folks moved out of it a
long time ago
and they took all their things
and they never came back
Looks like it's haunted
with the windows all cracked 
and everyone calls it
the house, the house where
nobody lives.

Once it held laughter
Once it held dreams
Did they throw it away
Did they know what it means
Did someone's heart break
or did someone do somebody wrong?

Well the paint was all cracked
It was peeled off of the wood
Papers were stacked on the porch
where I stood
and the weeds had grown up
just as high as the door
There were birds in the chimney
and an old chest of drawers
Looks like no one will ever
come back to the
House where nobody lives

Once it held laughter
Once it held dreams
Did they throw it away
Did they know what it means
Did someone's heart break
or did someone do somebody wrong?
So if you find someone
someone to have, someone to hold
Don't trade it for silver
Don't trade it for gold
I have all of life's treasures
and they are fine and they are good
They remind me that houses
Are just made of wood
What makes a house grand
Ain't the roof or the doors
If there's love in a house
It's a palace for sure
Without love
It ain't nothin but a house
A house where nobody lives
Without love it ain't nothin
But a house, A house where
Nobody lives.

# How's It Gonna End

He had 3 whole dollars, a worn out car and a wife who was leaving for good
Life's made of trouble worry pain and struggle
She wrote good bye in the dust on the hood 
They found a map of Missouri
Lipstick on the glass
They must of left in the middle of the nite

And I want to know
The same thing
Everyone wants to know
How it going to end?

Behind a smoke colored curtain, the girl disappeared, they found out te ring was a fake
A tree born crooked will never grow straight
She sunk like a hammer into the lake
A long lost letter and old leaky boat
Promises are never meant to keep

And I want to know
The same thing
Everyone wants to know
How it going to end?

The barn leaned over 
The vultures dried their wings
The moon climbed up an empty sky
The sun sank down behind the tree on the hill
There's a killer and he's coming thru the rye
But maybe he's the Father of that lost little girl
It's hard to tell in this light

And I want to know
The same thing
Everyone wants to know
How it going to end?
Drag your wagon and your plow over the bones of the dead
Out among the roses and the weeds
You can never go back
And the answer is no
And wishing for it only
Makes it bleed

Joel Tornabene was broken on the wheel
Shane and Bum Mahoney on the lamb
The grain was as gold as Sheila's hair
All the way from Liverpool with all we could steal
He was robbed of twenty dollars
His body found stripped
Cast into the harbour there and drowned

And I want to know
The same thing
Everyone wants to know
How it going to end?

The sirens are snaking their way up the hill
It's last call somewhere in the world
The reptiles blend in with the color of the street
Life is sweet at the edge of a razor
And down in the front row of an old picture show
The old man is asleep as the credits start to roll

And I want to know the same thing
Everyone wants to know how's it going to end?

# I Beg Your Pardon

I'm just a scarecrow without you
baby please don't disappear
I beg your pardon dear

I got a bottle for a trumpet
and a hatbox for a drum
I beg your pardon dear

I got upset 
I lost my head
I didn't mean the things I said
you are the landscape of my dreams
darling I beg your pardon

I'd give you Boardwalk and Park Place
and all of my hotels
I beg your pardon dear

please don't go back to St. Louis
can't you tell that I'm sincere
I beg your pardon dear

I got upset 
I lost my head
I didn't mean the things I said
you are the landscape of my dreams
darling I beg your pardon

# I Can't Wait To Get Off Work

Well I don't mind working 
cause I used to be jerking off
Most of my time in the the bars
I been a cabby and a stock clerk 
and a soda fountain jock jerk
and a manic mechanic on cars
it's nice work if you can get it 
now who the hell said it
I got money to spend on my girl
but the work never stops 
and I'll be busting my chops
Working for Joe & Sal

and I can't wait to get off work 
and see my baby
she said she'd leave the porch lite 
on for me
I'm disheveled I'm disdainful
I'm distracted and it's painful
but this job sweeping up here is 
gainfully employing me tonight

Tom do this Tom do that 
Tom don't do that
count the cash clean the oven 
dump the trash oh your lovin 
is a rare and a copasetic gift
I'm a moonlight watchmanic
it's hard to be romantic
(sweeping up over by the 
cigarette machine
sweeping up over by the cigarette machine)

and can't wait to get off work 
and see my baby
she'll be waiting up with a magazine for me
clean the bathrooms, clean um good
oh you're lovin I wish you would
come down here and sweepameoffmyfeet
this broom'll have to be my baby
if I hurry I just might 
get off before the dawns early light

# I Don't Wanna Grow Up

When I'm lyin' in my bed at night
I don't wanna grow up
Nothin' ever seems to turn out right
I don't wanna grow up
How do you move in a world of fog
That's always changing things
Makes me wish that I could be a dog
When I see the price that you pay
I don't wanna grow up
I don't ever wanna be that way
I don't wanna grow up

Seems like folks turn into things 
that they'd never want
The only thing to live for 
Is today...
I'm gonna put a hole in my TV set
I don't wanna grow up
Open up the medicine chest
And I don't wanna grow up
I don't wanna have to shout it out
I don't want my hair to fall out
I don't wanna be filled with doubt
I don't wanna be a good boy scout
I don't wanna have to learn to count
I don't wanna have the biggest amount
I don't wanna grow up

Well when I see my parents fight
I don't wanna grow up
They all go out and drinking all night
And I don't wanna grow up
I'd rather stay here in my room
Nothin' out there but sad and gloom
I don't wanna live in a big old tomb 
On Grand Street

When I see the 5 o'clock news
I don't wanna grow up
Comb their hair and shine their shoes
I don't wanna grow up
Stay around in my old hometown
I don't wanna put no money down
I don't wanna get me a big old loan
Work them fingers to the bone
I don't wanna float a broom
Fall in love and get married then boom
How the hell did it get here so soon
I don't wanna grow up

# I Hope That I Don't Fall In Love With You

Well, I hope that I don't fall in love with you
Cause falling in love just makes me blue
Well, the music plays and you display your heart for me to see
I had a beer and now I hear you calling out for me
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you

Well, the room is crowded, people everywhere
And I wonder, should I offer you a chair?
Well, if you sit down with this old clown, take that frown and break it
Before the evening's gone away, I think that we can make it
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you

Well, the night does funny things inside a man
These old tomcat feelings you don't understand
Well, I turn around to look at you, you light a cigarette
I wish I had the guts to bum one, but we've never met
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you

I can see that you are lonesome just like me
And it being late, you'd like some company
Well, I turn around to look at you, and you look back at me
The guy you're with he's up and split, the chair next to you is free
And I hope that you don't fall in love with me

Now it's closing time, the music's fading out
Last call for drinks, I'll have another stout
Well, I turn around to look at you, you're nowhere to be found
I search the place for your lost face, guess I'll have another round
And I think that I just fell in love with you

# I Never Talk to Strangers

Stop me if you've heard this one
But I feel as though we've met before
Perhaps I am mistaken
But it's just that I remind you of
Someone you used to care about
Oh but that was long ago
Now tell me do you really think I'd fall for that old line
I was not born just yesterday
Besides I never talk to strangers anyway

Hell I ain't a bad guy when you get to know me
I just thought there ain't no harm
Hey yeah just try minding your own business bud
Who asked you to annoy me
With your sad sad repartee
Besides I never talk to strangers anyway

Your life's a dime store novel
This town is full of guys like you
And you're looking for someone to take the place of her
You must be reading my mail
And you're bitter cause he left you
That's why you're drinking in this bar
Well only suckers fall in love with perfect strangers

It always takes one to know one stranger
Maybe we're just wiser now
Yeah and been around that block so many times
That we don't notice
That we're all just perfect strangers
As long as we ignore
That we all begin as strangers
Just before we find
We really aren't strangers anymore

# I Wish I Was In New Orleans

Well, I wish I was in New Orleans
I can see it in my dreams
arm in arm down Burgundy
a bottle and my friends and me
hoist up a few tall cool ones
play some pool and listen to that 
tenor saxophone calling me home
and I can hear the band begin
When The Saints Go Marching In
by the whiskers on my chin
New Orleans I'll be there

I'll drink you under the table
be red nose go for walks
the old haunts what I wants
is red beans and rice
and wear the dress I like so well
meet me at the old saloon
make sure there's a Dixie moon
New Orleans I'll be there

and deal the cards roll the dice
if it ain't that ole Chuck E. Weiss
and Clayborn Avenue me and you
Sam Jones and all
and I wish I was in New Orleans
I can see it in my dreams
arm in arm down Burgundy
a bottle and my friends and me
New Orleans, I'll be there

# I'll Be Gone

Tonight I'll shave the mountain
I'll cut the hearts from pharaohs
I pull the road off of the rise
tear the memories from my eyes
and in the morning I'll be gone
I drink 1000 shipwrecks
tonight I'll steal your paychecks
I paint the sheets across my bed
the birds will all fly from my head
and in the morning I'll be gone
take every dream that's breathing
find every boot that's leaving
shoot all the lights in the cafe
and in the morning I'll be gone
I bet 1000 dollars
I have a French companion
I tie myself below the deck
I pull the rope around my neck
and in the morning I'll be gone
it takes a life to win her
there is a drum of bourbon
800 pounds of nitro
his boots are thunder as he plays
there is a stone inside it
tonight his bones will ride it
I'll need a tent to hide it
and in the morning I'll be gone
and in the morning I'll be gone
and in the morning I'll be gone

# I'll Shoot The Moon

I'll shoot the moon 
Right out of the sky
For you baby
I'll be the pennies 
On your eyes
For you baby
I want to take you 
Out to the fair
Here's a red rose 
Ribbon for your hair
I'll shoot the moon 
Right out of the sky
For you baby
I'll shoot the moon 
For you
A vulture circles 
Over your head
For you baby
I'll be the flowers 
After you're dead
For you baby
I want to build 
A nest in your hair
I want to kiss you 
And never be there
I'll shoot the moon 
Right out of the sky
For you baby
I'll shoot the moon 
For you
You know I love you, baby
So why don't you call me?
You know my number
392-7704
Call any time
I'll shoot the moon right out of the sky
For you baby
I'll shoot the moon for you
I'll shoot the moon right out of the sky
For you baby
I'll be the flowers after you're dead
For you baby
I want to build a nest in your hair
I want to kiss you and never be there
I'll shoot the moon right out of the sky
For you baby
I'll shoot the moon for you

# I'll Take New York

I'll tip the newsboy 
I'll get a shine
I'll ride that dream 
to the end of the line
I'm goin' places 
I'll take a ride
Up to the Riverside
I'll take New York 
I'll let it happen
I'll pop the cork
tear off the wrappin'
I'll make a splash on the Hudson
that's how I will arrive
Hey, do you have two tens for a five?
Roll out the carpet 
Strike up the band
break into the best 
champagne when I land
Beat the Parade drum 
hit all the bars
I want the moon and stars
But I'll take NY
I'll make it all happen
Blow out the candles
tear off the wrappin'
And I know someday
they'll have to name a street after me
Right next door to old Franklin D

# I'm Still Here

You haven't looked at me that way in years
You dreamed me up and left me here
How long was I dreaming for
What was it you wanted me for
You haven't looked at me that way in years
Your watch has stopped and the pond is clear
Someone turn the lights back on
I'll love you til all time is gone
You haven't looked at me
That way in years
But I'm still here.

# Ice Cream Man

Well I'm clicking by your house about two forty-five

A big stick, momma, that will blow your mind
Cause I'm an ice cream man, I'm a one-man band, yeah

Honey, I'll be good to you
If you missed me in the alley, baby, don't you fret

Got something better than a swimming pool
Cause I'm an ice cream man, I'm a one-man band
I'm an ice cream man
Honey, I'll be good to you, yeah
Cause I'm an ice cream man, I'm a one-man band

# If I Have To Go

If I have to go will you remember me
will you find someone else while I'm away
there's nothing for me in this world full of strangers
it's all someone else's idea
I don't belong here and you can't go with me
you'll only slow me down
until I send for you don't wear your hair that way
if you cannot be true I'll understand
tell all the others you'll hold in your arms
that I said I'd come back for you
I'll leave my jacket to keep you warm
that's all that I can do
if I have to go will you remember me
will you find someone else while I'm away

# In The Colosseum

The women all control their men 
With razors and with wrists
And the princess squeezes grape juice 
On a torrid bloody kiss
What will you be wearing there
The lion or the raven hair?
The flesh will all be tearing
But the tail will be my own
In the colosseum tonight
This one's for the balcony
And this one's for the floor
As the senators decapitate 
The presidential whore
The bald headed senators 
Are splashing in the blood
The dogs are having someone 
who is screaming in the mud
In the colosseum tonight
Now it's raining and it's pouring 
On the pillaging and goring
The constable is swinging 
From the chains
For the dead there is no story
No memory no blame
Their families shout blue murder
But tomorrow it's the same
In the colosseum
A slowly acting poison 
Will be given to the favorite one
The dark horse will bring glory 
To the jailer and his men
It's always much more sporting 
When there's families in the pit
And the madness of the crowd 
Is an epileptic fit
In the colosseum...
No justice here, No liberty
No reason. No blame
There's no cause to taint the sweetest taste of blood
And greetings from the nation 
As we shake the hands of time
They're taking their ovations
The vultures stay behind
In the colosseum tonight...

# In The Neighborhood

Well, the eggs chase the bacon round the fryin' pan
And the whinin' dog pidgeons by the steeple bell rope
And the dogs tipped the garbage pails over last night
And there's always construction work bothering you
In the neighborhood
In the neighborhood
In the neighborhood
Well, Friday's a funeral and Saturday's a bride
And Sey's got a pistol on the register side
And the goddam delivery trucks, they make too much noise
And we don't get our butter delivered no more
In the neighborhood
In the neighborhood
In the neighborhood
Well, Big Mambo's kickin' his old grey hound
And the kids can't get ice cream, cause the market burned down
And the newspaper sleeping bags blow down the lane
And that goddam flatbed's got me pinned in again
In the neighborhood
In the neighborhood
In the neighborhood
There's a couple Filipino girls gigglin' by the church
And the window is busted and the landlord ain't home
And Butch joined the army, yeah, that's where he's been
And the jackhammer's digging up the sidewalks again
In the neighborhood
In the neighborhood
In the neighborhood
In the neighborhood
In the neighborhood
In the neighborhood

# Innocent When You Dream (78)

The bats are in the belfry
the dew is on the moor
where are the arms that held me
and pledged her love before
and pledged her love before
It's such a sad old feeling
the fields are soft and green
it's memories that I'm stealing
but you're innocent when you dream 
when you dream
you're innocent when you dream
Running through the graveyard
we laughed my friends and I
we swore we'd be together
until the day we died
until the day we died
It's such a sad old feeling
the fields are soft and green
it's memories that I'm stealing
but you're innocent when you dream 
when you dream
you're innocent when you dream
I made a golden promise
that we would never part
I gave my love a locket
and then I broke her heart
and then I broke her heart
It's such a sad old feeling
the fields are soft and green
it's memories that I'm stealing
but you're innocent when you dream 
when you dream
you're innocent when you dream

# Invitation To The Blues

Well she's up against the register 
with an apron and a spatula
with yesterday's deliveries 
and the tickets for the bachelors
she's a moving violation 
from her conk down to her shoes
but it's just an invitation to the blues
and you feel just like Cagney 
looks like Rita Hayworth
at the counter of the Schwab's Drugstore
you wonder if she might be single 
she's a loner likes to mingle
got to be patient and pick up a clue
she says howyougonnalikem, 
over medium or scrambled
anyways the only way 
be careful not to gamble
on a guy with a suitcase 
and a ticket gettin out of here
it's a tired bus station 
and an old pair of shoes
but it ain't nothin but an 
invitation to the blues
but you can't take your eyes off her 
get another cup of java
and it's just the way she pours it for you
jokin with the customers
and it's mercy mercy Mr. Percy 
there ain't nothin back in Jersey
but a broken down jalopy of a 
man I left behind
and a dream that I was chasin 
and a battle with the booze
and an open invitation to the blues
but she's had a sugar daddy 
and a candy apple caddy
and a bank account and everything 
accustom to the finer things
he probably left her for a socialite and 
he didn't love her cept at night
and then he's drunk and never 
even told her that he cared
So they took the registration 
and the car keys and her shoes
and left her with an invitation 
to the blues
but there's a Continental Trailways leaving 
local bus tonight, good evening
you can have my seat 
I'm stickin round here for awhile
get me a room at the Squire 
and the fillin station's hirin
I can eat here every night, what the hell have I got to lose
got a crazy sensation 
go or stay, and I've got to choose
and I'll accept your invitation 
to the blues

# Is There Any Way out of This Dream?

I can clearly see nothing is clear
I keep falling apart every year
lets take a hammer to it
there's no glamour in it
is there any way out of this dream
I'm as blue as I can possibly be
is there someone else out there for me
summer is dragging its feet
I feel so incomplete
is there any way out of this dream
summer is dragging its feet
I feel so incomplete
is there any way out of this dream

# It's Over

I must have brought the bad weather with me
the sky's the colour of lead
all you've left me was a feather
on an unmade bed
it's always me whenever there's trouble
the world does nothing but turn
the ring it fell off my finger
I guess I'll never learn
it's over it's over it's over
I'm getting dressed in the dark
our story ends before it begins
I always confess to everyone's sins
the nail gets hammered down
it's over let it go
so don't go and make a big deal out of nothing
it's just a storm on a dime
I've always found there's nothing
that money can not buy
I've already gone to the place that I'm going
there's no place left to fall
there's something to be said
about saying nothing at all
cause baby then it's over and it's over
it's done forgotten and through
story ends before it begins
I always confess to everyone's sins
the nail gets hammered down
it's over let it go
you got to let me go
I wanna let it go

# Jayne's Blue Wish

The sky holds all our wishes
the dish ran away with the spoon
chimney smoke ties the roofs to the sky
there's a hole over head
but it's only the moon
will there ever be a tree
grown from the seeds I've sown
life is a path lit only 
by the light of those I've loved
by the light of those I love
life's a path lit only by
the light of those I've loved
by the light of those I love

# Jesus Gonna Be Here

Well, Jesus will be here
Be here soon
He's gonna cover us up with leaves
With a blanket from the moon
With a promise and a vow
And a lullaby for my brow
Jesus gonna be here
Be here soon
Well I'm just gonna wait here
I don't have to shout
I have no reason and
I have no doubt
I'm gonna get myself 
Unfurled from this mortal coiled up world
Because Jesus gonna be here
Be here soon
I got to keep my eyes open
So I can see my Lord
I'm gonna watch the horizon
For a brand new Ford
I can hear him rolling on down the lane
I said Hollywood be thy name
Jesus gonna be
Gonna be here soon
Well, I've been faithful
And I've been so good
Except for drinking
But he knew that I would
I'm gonna leave this place better
Than the way I found it was
And Jesus gonna be here
Be here soon

# Jitterbug Boy

Well I'm a jitterbug boy 
by the shoe-shine resting on my laurels 
and my Hardy's too
life of Riley on the swing shift
girls follow my drift
once upon a time I was 
in show biz too
I seen the Brooklyn Dodgers 
playin at Ebbets Field
seen the Kentucky Derby too
It's fast women, slow horses, 
I'm reliable sources
and I'm holding up a lamp post 
if you want to know
I' seen the Wabash Cannonball 
buddy, I've done it all
because I slept with the lions 
and Marilyn Monroe
had breakfast in the eye 
of a hurricane
fought Rocky Marciano 
played Minnesota Fats
Burned hundred dollar bills 
I eaten Mulligan stew
Got drunk with Louis Armstrong
what's that old song
I taught Mickey Mantle
everything he knows
and so you'll ask me 
what I'm doin here
holdin up a lamp-post
flippin this quarter 
trying to make up my mind
and if it's heads I'll go to 
Tennessee, and tails I'll buy a drink
If it lands on the edge 
I'll keep talkin to you

# Jockey Full Of Bourbon

Edna Million in a drop dead suit
Dutch Pink on a downtown train
Two dollar pistol but the gun won't shoot
I'm in the corner on the pouring rain
16 men on a deadman's chest
And I've been drinking from a broken cup
2 pairs of pants and a mohair vest
I'm full of bourbon, I can't stand up
Hey little bird, fly away home
Your house is on fire, your children are alone
Hey little bird, fly away home
Your house is on fire, your children are alone
Schiffer broke a bottle on Morgan's head
And I've been stepping on the devil's tail
Across the stripes of a full moon's head
Through the bars of a Cuban jail
Bloody fingers on a purple knife
A flamingo drinking from a cocktail glass
I'm on the lawn with someone else's wife
Come admire the view from up on top of the mast
Hey little bird, fly away home
Your house is on fire, your children are alone
Hey little bird, fly away home
Your house is on fire, your children are alone
I said, hey little bird, fly away home
Your house is on fire, your children are alone
Hey little bird, fly away home
House is on fire, your children are alone
Yellow sheets in a Hong Kong bed
Stazybo horn and a Slingerland ride
To the carnival is what she said
A hundred dollars makes it dark inside
Edna Million in a drop dead suit
Dutch Pink on a downtown train
Two dollar pistol but the gun won't shoot
I'm in the corner on the pouring rain
16 men on a deadman's chest
And I've been drinking from a broken cup
2 pairs of pants and a mohair vest
I'm full of bourbon, I can't stand up
Hey little bird, fly away home
Your house is on fire, your children are alone
Hey little bird, fly away home
Your house is on fire, your children are alone

# Johnsburg, Illinois

She's my only true love
she's all that I think of
look here in my wallet 
that's her
she grew up on a farm there
there's a place on my arm
where I've written her name 
next to mine
you see I just can't 
live without her
and I'm her only boy
and she grew up outside McHenry
in Johnsburg, Illinois

# Just The Right Bullets

There is a light in the forest
There is a face in the tree
I'll pull you out of the chorus
And the first one's always free
You can never go a-hunting
With just a flintlock and a hound
You won't go home with a bunting
If you blow a hundred rounds
It takes much more than wild courage
Or you'll hit the tattered clouds
You must have just the right bullets
And the first one's always free
You must be careful in the forest
Broken glass and rusty nails
If you're to bring back something for us
I have bullets for sale
Why be a fool when you can chase away
Your blind and your gloom
I have blessed each one of these bullets
And they shine just like a spoon
To have sixty silver wishes
Is a small price to pay
They'll be your private little fishes
And they'll never swim away
I just want you to be happy
That's my only little wish
I'll fix your wagon and your musket
And the spoon will have its dish
And I shudder at the thought of your
Poor empty hunter's pouch
So I'll keep the wind from your barrel
And bless the roof of your house

# Kentucky Avenue

Well Eddie Grace's Buick got four bullet holes in the side
and Charlie DeLisle is sittin at the top of an avocado tree
Mrs. Storm will stab you with a steak knife if you step on her lawn
I got a half a pack of Lucky Strikes man so come along with me
and let's fill our pockets with macadamia nuts
and go over to Bobby Goodmanson's and jump off the roof
well Hilda plays strip poker when her mamas cross the street
Joey Navinski says she put her tongue in his mouth
and Dicky Faulkner's got a switchblade and some gooseneck risers
that eucalyptus is a hunchback there's a wind down from the south
so let me tie you up with kite string and I'll show you the scabs on my knee
watch out for the broken glass put your shoes and socks on
and come along with me
let's follow that fire truck I think your house is burnin down
asnd go down to the hobo jungle and kill some rattlesnakes with a trowel
and we'll break all the windows in the old Anderson place
and we'll steal a bunch of boysenberries and I'll smear em on your face
I'll get a dollar from my mama's purse and buy that skull and crossbones ring
and you can wear it round your neck on an old piece of string
Then we'll spit on Ronnie Arnold and flip him the bird
and slash the tires on the school bus now don't say a word
I'll take a rusty nail and scratch your initials in my arm
and I'll show you how to sneak up on the roof of the drugstore
I'll take the spokes from your wheelchair and a magpie's wings
and I'll tie em to your shoulders and your feet
I'll steal a hacksaw from my dad and cut the braces off your legs
and we'll bury them tonight out in the cornfield
just put a church key in your pocket we'll hop that freight train in the hall
we'll slide all the way down the drain to New Orleans in the fall

# King Kong

They shot him down
they shot him down
they thought he was a monster
but he was the king
they came to his island
and they brought her with them
they wanted to get his picture
but they were surprised 
by his enormous size
and when he saw the woman
he took her without question
because after all
he was the king
and he loved the woman
he loved the way she looked
and she wouldn't stop screaming
but he loved the woman
and he fought a Tyrannosaurus Rex
and it was a bloody battle
but he fought it for his woman
and he climbed up a mountain
and he looked around
some kind of forest
with all these dinosaurs
and he stripped his woman
he stripped her bare
but there was a pterodactyl
there
and then a hero
came and took his woman
and they fell off the mountain
into some water
and then later
he came looking for his woman
but they were waiting
and they threw a bomb
and they tied him
and took him across the ocean
and they chained him
and put him in the show
and when he saw his woman
he broke loose
and everyone fled in terror
and he was looking for her
and he overtook a train
and he was looking in the street
and then he found her in her apartment
and he climbed up 
the Empire State Building
it was like a phallic symbol
and he took his woman
to the top of that towering temple
and he climbed up and looked around
some kind of city
with all those skyscrapers
and all the cars
just him and his screaming woman
and they were finally alone
he loved his woman
you could see it in his eyes
his great big eyes
he loved his woman
from the moment that he saw her
he was all choked up inside
but when the airplanes came
he was soon to die
but he hung on long enough to set his woman down
and make sure that she was safe
and as the bullets pierced
he looked at her so sincere
before he fell
because he loved his woman
and they shot him down
they thought he was a monster
but he was the king
who killed the monkey
'twas beauty that killed the beast
and Willis O'Brien died
a tragic death
there wasn't much
that he had left
and Ray Harryhousen said
that when Willis died
that's when the king was really dead
they shot him down
they shot him down
they thought he was a monster
but he was the king

# Kiss Me

The fire’s dying out
All the embers have been spent
Outside on the street
Lovers hide in the shadows
You look at me
I look at you
There’s only one thing
I want you to do
Kiss me
I want you to kiss me
Like a stranger once again
Kiss me like a stranger once again
I want to believe that our love’s a mystery
I want to believe that our love’s a sin
I want you to kiss me like a stranger once again
You wear the same kind of perfume
You wore when we met
I suppose there’s something comforting in knowing what to expect
But when you brushed up against me
Before I knew your name
Everything was thrilling
Because nothing was the same
I want you to kiss me
I want you to kiss me
Like a stranger once again
Kiss me like a stranger once again
I want to believe our loves a mystery
I want to believe our loves a sin
Oh will you kiss me like a stranger once again
I want you to kiss me like a stranger
Kiss me like a stranger once again

# Last Leaf

I’m the last leaf on the tree
The autumn took the rest
But they won’t take me
I’m the last leaf on the tree
When the autumn wind blows
They’re already gone
They flutter to the ground
Cause they can’t hang on
There’s nothing in the world
That I ain’t seen
I greet all the new ones that are coming in green
I’m the last leaf on the tree
The autumn took the rest but they wont take me
I’m the last leaf on the tree
They say I got staying power
Here on the tree
But I’ve been here since Eisenhower
And I’ve out lived even he
I’m the last leaf on the tree
The autumn took the rest but they won’t take me
I’m the last leaf on the tree
I fight off the snow
I fight off the hail
Nothing makes me go
I’m like some vestigial tail
I’ll be here through eternity
If you want to know how long
If they cut down this tree
I’ll show up in a song
I’m the last leaf on the tree
The autumn took the rest but they won’t take me
I’m the last leaf on the tree
I’m the last leaf on the tree
I’m the last leaf on the tree

# The Last Rose Of Summer

I love the way 
The tattered clouds
Go wind across the sky
And summer goes 
And leave me
With a tear in my eye
I'm taking out my winter clothes
My garden knows what's wrong
The petals of my favorite rose
Be in the shadows dark and long
Though every year 
It's very clear
I should be used
To carrying on
But I can be found in the garden
Singing this song
When the last 
Rose of summer is gone

# Lie To Me

Lie to me baby
uh huh 
lie to me baby

till your real man comes

I really don't care 
if you do

# Little Boy Blue

Little boy blue 
come blow your horn
the dish ran away 
with the spoon
home again Saturday morn
he never gets up before noon
well she used to render you 
legal and tender
when you used to send her 
your promises boy
a diller 
a dollar 
unbutton your collar
and come out and holler 
out all of your noise
so little boy blue 
come blow your top
and cut it 
right down to the quick
don't sit home and cry 
on the fourth of July
around now you're 
hitting the bricks
so abracadabra 
now she disappeared
everything is canada dry
So watch your behavior 
and rattle your cage
With a bottle of bourbon 
goodbye
so little boy blue 
lost little bo peep
she fell through 
a hole in the nest
Now ain't it peculiar 
that she is finally cooled
your big wheel is 
just like all of the rest
whenever it rains 
the umbrellas complain
they always get 
played for a chump
so mark it and strike it 
she's history now
And you're hanging out 
at the pump
little boy blue 
come blow your horn
the dish ran away 
with the spoon
home again Saturday morn
he never gets up before noon
well she used to render you 
legal and tender
when you used to send her 
your promises boy
a diller 
a dollar 
unbutton your collar
and come out and holler 
out all of your noise

# Little Drop Of Poison

I like my town with a little drop of poison
nobody knows they're lining up to go insane
I'm all alone I smoke my friends down to the filter
but I feel much cleaner after it rains
she left in the fall that's her picture on the wall
she always had that little drop of poison
did the devil make the world while god was sleeping
you'll never get a wish from a bone
another long goodbye and a hundred sailors
that deep blue sky is my home
she left in the fall that's her picture on the wall
she always had that little drop of poison
well the rat always knows when he's in with weasels
here you loose a little every day
well I remember when a million was a million
they all have ways to make you pay
she left in the fall that's her picture on the wall
she always had that little drop of poison
she left in the fall that's her picture on the wall
she always had that little drop of poison

# Little Man

As sure as fire will burn
there's one thing you will learn
is things you have cherished
are things that you have earned
luck is when opportunity
meets with preparation
the same is true for every generation
little man
as you climb on my knee
the whole future lies in thee
little man
little man
never hurry 
take it slow
things worthwhile 
need time to grow
little man
don't look back
there are things that might distract
move ahead towards your goal
and the answers will unfold
little man
love is always in the air
it is there for those who care
little man
don't look back
there are things that might distract
move ahead towards your goal
and the answers will unfold
little man
love is always in the air
it is there for those who care
little man

# Little Trip To Heaven (On The Wings Of Your Love)

Little trip to heaven on the wings of your love
Banana moon is shining in the sky
Feel like I'm in heaven when you're with me
Know that I'm in heaven when you smile
Though we're stuck here on the ground I got something that I've found
And it's you
I don't have to take no trip to outer space
All I have to do is look at your face
And before I know it, I'm in orbit around you
Thanking my lucky stars that I've found you
When I see your constellation
Honey, you're my inspiration
And it's you
You're my North Star when I'm lost and feeling blue
The sun is breaking through the clouds, don't you don't you know it's true?
Honey, all the other stars seem dim around you
Thanking my lucky stars that I've found you
When I see your smiling face
Honey, I know nothing ever gonna take your place
And it's you
And it's you, and it's you
And it's you, and it's you
And it's you
And it's you
And it's you
Shoo-be-doo, ba-ba-da

# Live Circus

We put up our tent on a dark
Green knoll, outside of town by
The train tracks and a seagull dump
Topping the bill was Horse Face Ethel
And her Marvelous Pigs in satin
We pounded our steaks in the ground
All powder brown
And the branches spread like scary
Fingers reaching – we
Were in a pasture in Kankakee
And one eyed Myra, the queen of
The galley who trained the
Ostrich and the camels
She looked at me squinty with her 
One good eye in a Roy Orbison
t-shirt as she bottle fed
an Orangutan named
Tripod and then there was
Yodeling Elaine the
Queen of the air who wore a 
Dollar sign medallion and she
Had a tiny bubble of spittle
Around her nostril and a 
Little rusty tear, for she had
Lassoed and lost another
Tipsy sailor and over in
The burnt yellow tent
By the frozen tractor, the
Music was like electric sugar
And Zuzu Bolin played
"Stavin' Chain" and Mighty
Tiny on the saw and he
Threw his head back with a 
Mouth full of gold teeth
And they played lopsided heart
And moon over Dog Street and
By the time they played Moanin Low
I was soakin wet and wild eyed
And Doctor Bliss slipped me a 
Preparation and I fell asleep with
Livery Stable Blues in my ear
And me and Molly Hoey drank
Pruno and Koolaid she had a 
Tattoo gun made out of a cassette
Motor and a guitar string and 
she soaked a hanky in 3 roses
and rubbed it on the spot
and she drew a rickety heart and 
a bent arrow and it hurt like hell
and Funeral Wells spun
Poodle Murphy on the target
As he threw his hardware, only
Once in Sheboygan did he miss
At a matinee on Diamond Pier and
She'd never let him forget it
They were doing two shows and she
Had a high fever and he took
Off a piece of her ear and 
Tip Little told her she should
Leave the bum but
Poodle said, "he fetched me
Last time I run" and I'd 
Like to hammer this ring into
A bullet and I wish I
Had some whiskey and a gun
My dear, I wish I had some
Whiskey and a gun my dear

# Lonely

Lonely, lonely, lonely,
Lonely eyes, lonely face
Lonely, lonely in your place
Lonely, lonely
Lonely eyes, lonely face
Lonely, lonely in your place
I thought that I knew all that there was to
Lonely, lonely, lonely
Melanie Jane, won't feel the pain
Lonely, lonely
Lonely eyes, lonely face

And I thought that I knew all that there was to
Lonely, lonely,
Lonely eyes, lonely face

And I still love you,
I still love you
Lonely, lonely

# Long Way Home

Well I stumbled in the darkness
I'm lost and alone
though I said I'd go before us
and show the way back home
is there a light up ahead
I can't hold on very long
forgive me pretty baby but 
I always take the long way home
money's just something you throw
off the back of a train
I got a head full of lightning
a hat full of rain
I know that I said
I'd never do it again
I love you pretty baby but 
I always take the long way home
I put food on the table
and a roof over our head
but I'd trade it all tomorrow
for the highway instead
watch your back
keep your eyes shut tight
your love's the only thing I've ever known
one thing's for sure pretty baby
I always take the long way home
you know I love you baby
more than the whole wide world
you are my woman
you know you are my pearl
let's go out past the party lights
where we can finally be alone
come with me and we can 
take the long way home

# Lord I've Been Changed

I know I've been changed
I know I've been changed

angels in heaven 
done sign my name
angels in heaven

I'm gonna tell you just a what I seen
I said I know I've been changed
and I know I've been changed yeah

angels in heaven 
done sign my name

# Lost In The Harbour

Over here the ladies
All want sweet perfume
But there's never a rose
And over there
The roses are frightened to bloom
So they never can grow
And over here they need wool
For weaving baby's new clothes
But nobody has any wool
And the sheep are all lost
In the harbour
And over here
They want diamonds to wear
But there aren't any here
And over there,
Everyone's hiding their tears
But they're crying inside
And the wall won't come down
Til they're no longer afraid of themselves
If you don't believe me, ask yourselves
And I can come down
To the harbour
And then I will fill the ocean
Back up with my tears
I still have a couple more years
And then I can come back
To the harbour

# LowDown

She is a crooked sheriff 
in a real straight town
she opened the door 
shake shake shake 
the lights go down
clover honey and the jimson weed
red leather skirt 
way up above her knees
oh yeah my baby is lowdown
she's a gone lost dirt road
there ain't no way back 
I been told
she's a story 
they all tell
she's a rebel
she's a yell
oh yeah my baby is lowdown
white heat in a cold rain
I'm a merging here 
in your merging lane
Jockey La Fayette 
Big Eyed Al
the second hand moon 
is shining for my gal
she is a big red flag 
in a mean bullpen
she'll steal it from you 
sell it right back to you again
well she's a wild rose 
she is not settled
cold gun of ice blue metal
oh yeah my baby is lowdown
white heat in a cold rain
I'm a merging here in your merging lane
Jockey La Fayette 
Big Eyed Al
she is a cheap motel 
with a burned out sign
she'll take care of you 
definitely every time
she got a stolen check book 
and legs up to there
singing into a hairbrush 
right in front of the mirror
oh yeah my baby is lowdown

# Lowside Of The Road

I'm on a black elevator 
goin down 
Little Joe from Kokomo
it rattles to the ground
The dice is laughin at the 
man that he throwed
Your rollin over to the
Lowside of the road
The moon is red and your
dancin real slow
29 miles left to go
The chain monkeys
help you with your load
You're rollin over to the
Lowside of the road
Jezebel is naked
with an axe
the prosecution tells you
to relax
Your head feels like it's ready
to explode
You're rollin over, you're rollin over 
Well the clapper has been ripped
out of the bell
The flapper has been kicked right
out of hell
When the horse whips the
man that he rode
You're rollin over to the Lowside of the road
The dog won't bite if you beat
him with a bone
She's so shy when she's
talkin on the phone
The ground rises up and starts to
groan 
You're rollin over to the
Lowside of the road

# Lucinda

Well they call me William the Pleaser
I sold opium fireworks and lead
now I'm telling my troubles to strangers
when the shadows get long I'll be dead
now her hair was as black as a bucket of tar
her skin as white as a cuttlefish bone
I left Texas to follow Lucinda
Nnw I'll never see heaven or home
I made a wish on a sliver of moonlight
a sly grin and a bowl full of stars
like a kid who captures a firefly
and leaves it only to die in the jar
as I kick at the clouds at my hanging
as I swing out over the crowd
I will search every face for Lucinda's
and she will go off with me down to hell
I thought I'd broke loose of Lucinda
the rain returned and so did the wind
I cast this burden on the god that is within me
and I'll leave this old world and go free
the devil dances inside empty pockets
but she never wanted money or pearls
no that wasn't enough for Lucinda
she wasn't that kind of girl
now I've fallen from grace for Lucinda
whoever thought that hell he'd so low
I did well for an old tin can sailor
but she wanted the bell in my soul
I've spoken the god on the mountain
I've swam in the Irish sea
I ate fire and drank from the Ganges
I'll beg there for mercy for me
I thought I'd broke loose from Lucinda
the rain returned and so did the wind
I was standing outside the Whitehorse
oh but I was afraid to go in
I heard someone pull the trigger
her breasts heaved in the moonlight again
there was a smear of gold in the window
and then I was the jewel of her sin
they call me William the Pleaser
I sold opium fireworks and lead
now I'm telling my troubles to strangers
when the shadows get long I'll be dead
her hair was a black as a bucket of tar
skin as white as a cuttlefish bone
I left Texas to follow Lucinda
I know I'll never see heaven or home

# Lucky Day

The prettiest girl 
in all the world
is in a little Spanish town
but I left her for a Bonnie lass
and I told her 
I'd see her around
But that Bonnie lass 
and her heart of glass
would not hold a candle 
to bumming around
so don't cry for me 
for I'm going away
and I'll be back some lucky day
Tell the boys back home
I'm doing just fine
I left all my troubles and woe
so sing about me
for I can't come home
I've many more miles to go
Why there's Miss Kelsey
you taught dance at our school
and old Johnny O'Toole
I'll still beat you at pool
so don't cry for me
for I'm going away
and I'll be back some lucky day
Now when I was a boy
My daddy sat me on his knee
And he told me
He told me many things
And he said son 
There's alot of things in this world
You're gonna have no use for
And when you get blue 
And you've lost all your dreams
There's nothin like a campfire 
And a can of beans
Why there's Miss Kelsey
She taught dance at our school
And old Johnny O 'Toole
I'll still beat you at pool
So don't cry for me
For I'm goin' away
And I'll be back some lucky day

# Martha

Operator, number please, it's been so many years
Will she remember my old voice while I fight the tears
Hello, hello there, is this Martha, this is old Tom Frost
And I am calling long distance, don't worry about the cost
'Cause it's been forty years or more, now Martha please recall
Meet me out for coffee, where we'll talk about it all
And those were the days of roses, of poetry and prose
And Martha all I had was you and all you had was me
There was no tomorrows, we packed away our sorrows
And we saved them for a rainy day
And I feel so much older now, and you're much older too
How's your husband, and how's your kids, you know that I got married too
Lucky that you found someone to make you feel secure
'Cause we were all so young and foolish, now we are mature
And those were the days of roses, of poetry and prose
And Martha all I had was you and all you had was me
There was no tomorrows, we packed away our sorrows
And we saved them for a rainy day
And I was always so impulsive, I guess that I still am
And all that really mattered then was that I was a man
I guess that our being together was never meant to be
And Martha, Martha, I love you, can't you see
And those were the days of roses, of poetry and prose
And Martha all I had was you and all you had was me
There was no tomorrows, we packed away our sorrows
And we saved them for a rainy day
And I remember quiet evenings, trembling close to you

# Medley: Jack & Neal / California Here I Come

Jack was sitting poker faced with bullets backed with bitches
Neal hunched at the wheel putting everyone in stitches
Bragging about some nurse he screwed while driving through Nebraska
And when she came she honked the horn
Neal just barely missed a truck
And then he asked her if she'd like to come like that to California
You see a red head in a uniform will always get you horny
Yeah and with her hairnet and those white shoes and a name tag and a hat
She drove like Andy Granatelli and knew how to fix a flat
And Jack was almost at the bottom of his MD 2020
Neal was yelling out the window trying to buy some bennies
From a Lincoln full of Mexicans and the left rear tire blowed
And the sons of bitches pretty near almost ran us off the road
And while the nurse had spilled the Maneshewitz all up and down her dress
And then she lit the map on fire Neal just had to guess
Should we try and find a bootleg route or a filling station open
The nurse was dumping out her purse and looking for an envelope
And Jack was out of cigarettes and as we crossed the yellow line
The gas pumps looked like tombstones from here
And it felt lonelier than a parking lot when the last car pulls away
And the moonlight dressed the double breasted foothills in the mirror
Weaving out a negligee and a black brassiere
And the Mercury was running hot and we were almost out of gas
Just then Florence Nightingale she dropped her drawers and
Stuck her fat ass half way out of the window to a Wilson Pickett tune
And shouted Get a load of this and gave the finger to the moon
Counting one eyed Jacks and whistling dixie in the car
Neal was doing least a hundred when we saw a falling star
And Florence wished that Neal would hold her instead of chewing on his cigar
Jack was nodding out and wishing he was in a bar
With Charlie Parker on the bandstand and not a worry in the world
And a glass of beer in one hand and his arms around a girl
Neal was singing to the nurse Underneath the Harlem Moon
And somehow you could just tell we'd be in California soon
Open up your golden gates
California here I come
I said California here I come
Look out California here I come

# Metropolitan Glide

Are you ready, are you ready
Knocky Parker told Bowlegged Sal
They all know how to kick it in Cal
They're playing this dope and this money tune
Dancing baby with a 7 mile broom
Things are bulging out the rafters
Like hell
Down there at the Hush Hotel
They're jumping right out of their
Seats, dancing to the bran' new beat
Do the Metropolitan Glide
Do the Metropolitan Glide
The floor is polished and you Momma's gone
You can quake and roll and moan
29 gypsies in a Cadillac stoned
Turn off the ringer on your cellular phone
Whip the air like a Rainbow Trout
Drag your tail pipe till you bottom out
Do the Metropolitan Glide
Do the Metropolitan Glide
Do the Metropolitan Glide
Do the Metropolitan Glide
The low bottom of the china moon
The black swan and the way too soon
Ace pocket and the dog bone gone
The peacock and the mean black swan
The rain shower and high heeled shoe
Bombay money and I know I can do it
The sink hole and the victory dance
Its in the pocket in the real tight pants
Do the Metropolitan Glide
Do the Metropolitan Glide
Show your teeth bray like a calf
You kill me with your machine gun laugh
You make me trouble with the floor
That's creaking
I've been ready to ka boom for a week
Put on your stockings and your powder and blush
Keep it all on the hush, hush, hush
Do the Metropolitan Glide
Do the Metropolitan Glide

# Midnight Lullaby

Sing a song of sixpence, pocket full of rye
Hush-a-bye my baby, no need to be crying
You can burn the midnight oil with me as long as you will
Stare out at the moon upon the windowsill and dream
Sing a song of sixpence, a pocket full of rye
Hush-a-bye my baby, no need to be crying
There's dew drops on the windowsill, and gumdrops in your head
You're slipping into dreamland, you're nodding your head
So dream
Dream of West Virginia, or of the British Isles
'Cause when you are dreaming, you see for miles and miles
When you are much older, remember when we sat
At midnight on the windowsill, and had this little chat
And dream
Come on and dream
Come on and dream
And dream
And dream
Come on and dream

# Misery Is The River Of The World

Misery's the River of the World
Misery's the River of the World
The higher that the monkey can climb
the more he shows his tail
Call no man happy ëtil he dies
There's no milk at the bottom of the pail
God builds a church
The devil builds a chapel
Like the thistles that are growing
ëround the trunk of a tree
All the good in the world
You can put inside a thimble
And still have room for you and me
If there's one thing you can say
About Mankind
There's nothing kind about man
You can drive out nature with a pitch fork
But it always comes roaring back again
Misery's the River of the World
Misery's the River of the World
Misery's the River of the World
For want of a bird
The sky was lost
For want of a nail
A shoe was lost
For want of a life
A knife was lost
For want of a toy
A child was lost
Misery's the River of the World
Misery's the River of the World
Everybody Row! Everybody Row!
Misery's the River of the World
Misery's the River of the World
Everybody Row! Everybody Row!
Everybody Row!

# More Than Rain

It's more than rain that falls on our parade tonight
it's more than thunder it's more than thunder
it's more than a swindle this crooked card game
it's more than sad times it's more than sad times
none of our pockets are filled with gold
nobody's caught the bouquet
there are no dead presidents we can fold
nothing is going our way
and it's more than goodbye I have to say to you
it's more than woe-be-gotten grey skies now

# Mr. Henry

Mr. Henry staggers home when the evening's done
 He's as poor as a church mouse, high on the Meyer's rum 
Tuggin' at his shirttail, jinglin' his church key 
Chewin' on a toothpick, on another binge 
Tramplin' the rosebush, whistlin' to himself 
Now don't wake up the neighbors, spittin' on the hinge
Rattlin' the milk bottles and trippin' on a skate
 Hidin' from the newsboy before it's too late
The screen door's open, don't make no noise in the kitchen 
Got no excuse for a cold gray wife that starts bitchin'
 That the no good bum is at it again 
After she's given him all the best years of her life 
He'll tell her he was celebrating Savage's divorce
 Played a hunch out at Yonkers, you can never trust a horse
 And thrown in jail, and swore he'd never do these things again 
He's got an alibi,  but never tells her where he's been
"Henry!"
 "Henry!"

# Mr. Siegal

I spent all my money in a Mexican whorehouse baby
cross the street from a Catholic church
and I wiped off my revolver
and I buttoned up my burgundy shirt
I shot the morning in the back with my red wings on
told the sun he better go back down
and if I can find a book of matches
I'm goin to burn this hotel down
you got to tell me brave captain
why are the wicked so strong
how do the angels get to sleep
when the devil leaves his porch light on
well I dropped thirty grand on the nugget slots
I had to sell my ass on Fremont Street
and the drummer said theres sanctuary
over at the bagdad room
oh and now thats one for the money two for the show
three to get ready and go man go
I said tell me mister Siegel
how do I get out of here
Willard's knocked out on a bottle of heat
drivin dangerous curves across the dirty sheets
he said man you ought to see her when her parents are gone
man you ought to hear her when the sirens on
I said tell me brave captain
why are the wicked so strong
how do the angels get to sleep
when the devil leaves the porch light on
don't you know that ain't no broken bottle that I picked up in my headlights
on the other side of the Nevada line
where they live hard die young
and have a good lookin corpse every time
well you know the pit boss said: I should keep movin
this is where you go when you die
so I shot a black beauty
and I kissed her right between the eyes
oh well Willard's knocked out on a bottle of heat
drivin dangerous curves across the dirty sheets
he said when the bitch is wound up and her parents are gone
man you ought to hear her with the siren on
I said tell me brave captain
why are the wicked so strong
how do the angels get to sleep
when the devil leaves his porch light on
I spent all my money now in a Mexican whorehouse
cross the street from a Catholic church
and then I wiped off my revolver
and I buttoned up my burgundy shirt
I shot the morning in the back with my red wings on
I told the sun he'd better go back down
and if I can find a book of matches
I'm goin to burn this hotel down
well it's one for the money two for the show
I said three to get ready and go man go
I said tell me mister Siegel
how do I get out of here

# Murder In The Red Barn

There was a murder in the red barn
Murder in the red barn
The trees are bending over 
The cows are lying down
The autumn's taking over
You can hear the Buckshot hounds
The watchman said to Reba the loon
Was it pale at Manzanita
Or Blind Bob the racoon?
Pin it on a drifter 
They sleep beneath the bridge
One plays the violin 
And sleeps inside a fridge
There was a murder in the red barn
A murder in the red barn
Someone's crying in the woods
Someone's burying all his clothes
Now Slam the Crank from Wheezer 
Slept outside last night and froze
Road kill has its seasons 
Just like anything
It's possums in the autumn 
And it's farm cats in the spring
There was a murder in the red barn
A murder in the red barn
Now thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house 
Or covet thy neighbor's wife
But for some 
Murder is the only door thru which they enter life
Now they surrounded the house
They smoked him out
They took him off in chains
The sky turned black and bruised 
And we had months of heavy rains
Now the ravens nest in the rotted roof 
Of Chenoweth's old place
And noone's asking Cal 
About that scar upon his face
'Cause there's nothin' strange 
About an axe with bloodstains in the barn
There's always some killin' 
You got to do around the farm
A murder in the red barn
Murder in the red barn
Now the woods will never tell 
What sleeps beneath the trees
Or what's buried 'neath a rock 
Or hiding in the leaves
'Cause road kill has it's seasons 
Just like anything
It's possums in the autumn 
And it's farm cats in the spring
There was a murder in the red barn
A murder in the red barn
A murder in the red barn
Now a lady can't do nothin' 
Without folks' tongues waggin'
Is that blood on the tree 
Or is it autumn's red blaze
When the ground's soft for diggin' 
And the rain will bring all this gloom
There's nothing wrong with a lady 
Drinking alone in a room
But there was a murder in the red barn
A murder in the red barn

# Muriel

Muriel since you left town
The clubs closed down
And there's one more burned out lamp post
On Main Street
Down where we used to stroll
And Muriel
I still hit all the same old haunts
And you follow me wherever I go
And Muriel I see you
On a Saturday night
In a penny arcade
With your hair tied back
And the diamond twinkle
Is in your eye
Is the only wedding ring that I'll buy you
Muriel
And Muriel how many times
I've left this town
To hide from your memory
And it haunts me
But I only get as far
As the next Whiskey bar
I buy another cheap cigar
And I'll see you every night
Hey Muriel
Muriel
Hey buddy
Got a light

# Never Let Go

Well ring the bell backwards 
bury the axe
fall down on your knees in the dirt
I'm tied to the mast 
between water and wind
believe me you'll never get hurt
now the ring's in the pawnshop
the rain's in the hole
down at the Five Points I stand
I'll lose everything
but I won't let go of your hand
now Peter denied and Judas betrayed
I'll pay with the roll of the drum
the wind will tell the turn from the wheel
the watchman's making his rounds
well you leave me hanging 
by the skin of my teeth
I've only got one leg to stand
you can send me to hell
but I'll never let go of your hand
swing from a rope on a cross-legged tree
signed with the one-eyed jack's blood
from Temple and Union
to Weyley and Grand
walking back home in the mud
I must make my best of the only way home
Marley deals only in stones
I'm lost on the midway
I'm reckless in your eyes
just give me a couple more throws
I'll dare you to dine with 
the cross-legged knights
dare me to jump and I will
I'll fall from your grace
but I'll never let go of your hand
I'll never let go of your hand

# New Coat Of Paint

Let's put a new coat of paint
On this lonesome old town
Set 'em up, we'll be knocking 'em down
You wear a dress
Baby I'll wear a tie
We'll laugh at that old bloodshot moon
In that Burgundy sky
All our scribbled love dreams
Are lost or thrown away
Here amidst the shuffle
Of an overflowing day
Love needs a transfusion
Let's shoot it full of wine
Fishing for a good time
Starts with throwing in your line
So let's put a new coat of paint
On this lonesome old town
Set 'em up, set 'em up, we'll be knocking 'em down
You wear a dress baby
I'll wear a tie
We'll laugh at that old bloodshot moon
In that burgundy sky

# New Year's Eve

The door was open I was seething
Your mother burst in it was freezing
She said it looks like it’s trying to rain
I was lost I felt sea sick
You convinced me that he’d left
You said keep talking but don’t use any names
I scolded your driver and your brother
We are old enough to know how long you’ve been hooked
And we’ve all been through the war
And each time you score
Someone gets hauled and handcuffed and booked
It felt like four in the morning
What sounded like fire works
Turned out to be just what it was
The stars looked like diamonds
Then came the sirens
And everyone started to cuss
All the noise was disturbing
And I couldn’t find Irving
It was like two stations on at the same time
And then I hid your car keys
And I made black coffee
And I dumped out the rest of the rum
Nick and Socorro broke up
And Candice wouldn’t shut up
Fin he recorded the whole thing
Ray he said damn you
And someone broke my camera
And it was New Years
And we all started to sing
Should auld acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind
Should auld acquaintance be forgot for the sake of auld lang syne
I was leaving in the morning with Charles for Las Vegas
And I didn’t plan to come back
I had only a few things
Two hundred dollars
And my records in a brown paper sack
I ran out on Sheila
Everything’s in storage
Calvin’s right I should go back to driving truck
Should auld acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind
Should auld acquaintance be forgot for the sake of auld lang syne

# Nighthawk Postcards (From Easystreet)

Yeah, you check out the street and it looks like there's kind of a
Kind of a blur drizzle down the plate glass
And as a neon swizzle stick is stirring up the sultry night air
Looks like a yellow biscuit of a buttery cue ball moon
Rolling maverick across an obsidian sky
And as the buses go groaning and wheezing
Down on the corner I'm freezing
On a restless boulevard at a midnight road
I'm across town from Easy Street
With the tight knots of moviegoers and out-of-towners on the stroll
The buildings towering high above lit like dominoes or black dice
Used car salesmen dressed up in Purina checkerboard slacks
And Foster Grant wraparounds
Pacing in front of Rainbow, Earl Scheib, thirty-nine ninety-five merchandise.
Like barkers at a shooting gallery
They throw out a Texas Guinan routine:
'Hello sucker, we like your money, just as well as anybody else's here
Come on over here now...
Let me put the cut back in your strut and the glide back in your stride
Now climb aboard a customs Oldsmobile, let me take you for a ride'
Or they give you that P. T. Barnum bit:
'There's a sucker born every minute!'
'You just happened to be coming along at the right time, you know
Come over here now'
And you know, all the harlequin sailors are on the stroll
In search of like new new paint
And decent factory air and AM-FM dreams.
Yeah, and all the piss yellow gypsy cabs
They're stacked up in the taxi zones
And they're waiting like pinball machines
To be ticking off a joyride to a magical place
Like Truckers Welcome diners
With dirt lots full of Peterbilts and Kenworths and Jimmies and the like
They're hi-balling with bankrupt brakes
Man, they're overdriven and they're underpaid
They're overfed, and they're a day late and a dollar short
But Christ, I got my lips around a bottle
And I got my foot on the throttle and I'm standing on the corner
Standing on the corner like a just got in town Jasper
I'm on a street corner with a gasper
Looking for some kind of a Cheshire billboard grin
Stroking a goateed chin
Using parking meters as walking sticks
Yeah, on the inebriated stroll
With my eyelids propped open at half mast
But you know, over at "Chubb's Pool and Snooker"
Well, it was a nickel after two, yeah, it was a nickel after two
And in the cobalt steel blue dream smoke
Why, it was the radio that groaned out the hit parade
And the chalk squeaked and the floorboards creaked
And an Olympia sign winked through a torn yellow shade
Old Jack Chance himself leaning up against a Wurlitzer
Man, he was eyeballing out a five ball combination shot
Impossible you say? Hard to believe?
Perhaps out of the realm of possibility?
Naaaah
Cause he be stretching out long tawny fingers
Out across a cool green felt in a provocative golden gate
He got a full table railshot that's no sweat
And I leaned up against my banister
I wandered over to the Wurlitzer and I punched A2
I was looking for maybe 'Wine Wine Wine' by the Nightcaps
Starring Chuck E. Weiss
Or maybe... maybe a little something called "High Blood Pressure"
By George (Crying in the Streets) Perkins, no dice
'Cause that's life, that's what all the people say
You're riding high in April, you're seriously shot down in May
I know I'm gonna change that tune
When I'm standing underneath a buttery moon
That's all melted off to one side
Parkay
It was just about that time that the sun came crawling yellow
Out of a manhole at the foot of twenty-third Street
And a Dracula moon in a black disguise
Was making its way back to its pre-paid room at the St. Moritz Hotel
And the El train tumbled across the trestles
And it sounded like the ghost of Gene Krupa
With an overhead cam and glasspaks
And the whispering brushes of wet radials on wet pavement
Shhhhhhhhhhhhsh
With a traffic jam session on Belmont tonight
And the rhapsody of the pending evening
I leaned up against my banister
And I've been looking for some kind of an emotional investment
With romantic dividends
Yeah, kind of a physical negotiation is underway
As I attempt to consolidate all my missed weekly rendezvous
Into one low monthly payment, through the nose
With romantic residuals and legs akimbo
But the chances are that more than likely
Standing underneath a moon holding water
I'll probably be held over for another
Smashed weekend
Thank you

# Ninth & Hennepin

Well it's 9th and Hennepin
All the donuts have 
Names that sound like prostitutes
And the moon's teeth marks are 
On the sky like a tarp thrown over all this
And the broken umbrellas like 
Dead birds and the steam 
Comes out of the grill like 
The whole goddamned town is ready to blow
And the bricks are all scarred with jailhouse tattoos
And everyone is behaving like dogs
And the horses are coming down Violin Road
And Dutch is dead on his feet
And the rooms all smell like diesel
And you take on the 
Dreams of the ones who have slept here
And I'm lost in the window 
I hide in the stairway
I hang in the curtain
I sleep in your hat
And no one brings anything 
Small into a bar around here
They all started out with bad directions
And the girl behind the counter has a tattooed tear
One for every year he's away she said, such 
A crumbling beauty, but there's 
Nothing wrong with her that
$100 won't fix, she has that razor sadness 
That only gets worse
With the clang and the thunder of the 
Southern Pacific going by
As the clock ticks out like a dripping faucet
Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin
And you spill out 
Over the side to anyone who'll listen
And I've seen it 
All through the yellow windows 
Of the evening train

# Nirvana

Not much chance completely cut loose from purpose
he was a young man riding a bus through North Carolina on the way to somewhere
and it began to snow
and the bus stopped at a little café in the hills 
and the passengers entered
and he sat at the counter with the others 
and he ordered the food arrived
and the meal was particularly good
and the coffee
the waitress was unlike the women he had known
she was unaffected and there was a natural humor which came from her
and the fry cook said crazy things
and the dishwasher in back laughed a good clean pleasant laugh
and the young man watched the snow through the window
and he wanted to stay in that café forever
the curious feeling swam through him that everything was beautiful there
and it would always stay beautiful there
and then the bus driver told the passengers that it was time to board
and the young man thought I'll just stay here 
I'll just stay here
and then he rose and he followed the others into the bus
he found his seat and looked at the café through the window
and then the bus moved off down a curve downward out of the hills
and the young man looked straight forward
and he heard the other passengers speaking of other things
or they were reading or trying to sleep
and they hadn't noticed the magic
and the young man put his head to one side
closed his eyes and pretended to sleep
there was nothing else to do
just to listen to the sound of the engine
and the sound of the tires
in the snow

# No One Knows I'm Gone

Hell above and heaven below
All the trees are gone
The rain makes such a lovely sound
To those who are six feet under ground
The leaves will bury every year
And no one knows I'm gone
Live me golden tell me dark
Hide from Graveyard John
But the moon is full here every night
And I can bathe here in his light
The leaves will bury every year
And no one knows I'm gone

# Nobody

Nobody, nobody
Will ever love you the way I could love you
Cause nobody, nobody is that strong
Love is bittersweet
And life's treasures deep
And no one can keep a love that's gone wrong
Nobody, nobody
Will love you the way that I could
Cause nobody, nobody's that strong
Cause nobody is that strong
Nobody, nobody
Will ever love you the way I can love you
Cause nobody, nobody's that strong
You've had many lovers
You'll have many others
But they'll only just break your poor heart in two
Nobody, nobody
Will love you the way that I could
Cause nobody, nobody's that strong
Cause nobody is that strong

# November

No shadow 
No stars
No moon 
No cars
November
It only believes 
In a pile of dead leaves
And a moon 
That's the color of bone
No prayers for November 
To linger longer
Stick your spoon in the wall
We'll slaughter them all
November has tied me 
To an old dead tree
Get word to April 
To rescue me
November's cold chain 
Made of wet boots and rain
And shiny black ravens 
On chimney smoke lanes
November seems odd
You're my firing squad
November
With my hair slicked back 
With carrion shellac
With the blood from a pheasant 
And the bone from a hare
Tied to the branches 
Of a roebuck stag
Left to wave in the timber 
Like a buck shot flag
Go away you rainsnout
Go away blow your brains out
November

# The Ocean Doesn't Want Me

The ocean doesn't want me today
But I'll be back tomorrow to play
And the strangels will take me 
Down deep in their brine
The mischievous braingels
Down into the endless blue wine
I'll open my head and let out 
All of my time
I'd love to go drowning
And to stay and to stay
But the ocean doesn't want me today
I'll go in up to here
It can't possibly hurt
All they will find is my beer 
And my shirt
A rip tide is raging 
And the life guard is away
But the ocean doesn't want me today
The ocean doesn't want me today

# Ol' '55

Well, my time went so quickly
I went lickety-splitly out to my ol' fifty-five
As I pulled away slowly, feeling so holy
God knows I was feeling alive
Now the sun's coming up, I'm riding with Lady Luck
Freeway cars and trucks
Stars beginning to fade, and I lead the parade
Just a-wishing I'd stayed a little longer
Oh Lord, let me tell you that the feeling getting stronger
And it's six in the morning
Gave me no warning, I had to be on my way
Well, there's trucks all a-passing me, and the lights all a-flashin'
I'm on my way home from your place
And now the sun's coming up, I'm riding with Lady Luck
Freeway cars and trucks
Stars beginning to fade, and I lead the parade
Just a-wishing I'd stayed a little longer
Oh Lord, let me tell you the feeling getting stronger
And my time went so quickly
I went lickety-splitly out to my ol' fifty-five
As I pulled away slowly, feeling so holy
God knows I was feeling alive
And now the sun's coming up, I'm riding with Lady Luck
Freeway cars and trucks
Freeway cars and trucks
Freeway cars and trucks

# Old Boyfriends

Old boyfriends
Lost in the pocket of your overcoat
Like burned out light bulbs on a Ferris Wheel
Old boyfriends
You remember the kinds of cars they drove
Parking in an orange grove
He fell in love, you see
With someone that I used to be
Though I very seldom think of him
Nevertheless sometimes a mannequin's
Blue summer dress can make the window like a dream
Ah, but now those dreams belong to someone else
Now they talk in their sleep
In a drawer where I keep all my
Old boyfriends
Remember when you were burning for them
Why do you keep turning them into
Old boyfriends
They look you up when they're in town
To see if they can still burn you down
He fell in love, you see
With someone that I used to be
Though I very seldom think of him
Nevertheless sometimes a mannequin's
Blue summer dress can make the window like a dream
Ah, but now those dreams belong to someone else
Now they talk in their sleep
In a drawer where I keep all my
Old boyfriends
Turn up every time it rains
Fall out of the pages in a magazine
Old boyfriends
Girls fill up the bars every spring
Not places for remembering
Old boyfriends
All my old boyfriends
Old boyfriends

# Old Shoes (And Picture Postcards)

I'm singing this song, it's time it was sung
I've been putting it off for a while
But it's harder by now, cause the truth is so clear
That I cry when I'm seeing you smile
So goodbye, so long, the road calls me, dear
And your tears cannot bind me anymore
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes
Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone
Every time that I tried to tell you that we'd
Lost the magic we had at the start
I would weep in my heart when I looked in your eyes
And I'd search once again for the spark
So goodbye, so long, the road calls me, dear
And your tears cannot bind me anymore
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes
Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone
I can see by your eyes, it's time now to go
So I'll leave you to cry in the rain
Though I held in my hand, the key to all joy
But honey, my heart was not born to be tamed
So goodbye, so long, the road calls me, dear
And your tears cannot bind me anymore
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes
Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone
So goodbye, so long, the road calls me dear
And your tears cannot bind me anymore
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes
Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone
Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone
Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone

# On A Foggy Night

It was all upon a foggy night, an abandoned road
In a twilight mirror mirage
With no indication of any kind of service station
Or an all-night garage
I was misinformed, I was misdirected
Cause the interchange never intersected
Leaving me marooned beneath a bloodshot moon
All upon a foggy night, a foggy night
All upon a foggy night
It was kind of an abandoned road, in a blurred brocade collage
Is that a road motel, I can't really tell
You gotta tell me, is that a vacancy lodge
There's no consolation, what kind of situation
To be aimlessly askew amidst a powder blue
No tell-tale light clue
Spun just like the spell you spin
This precarious pandemonium
Roslyn, I'm stranded, all upon a foggy night
Like a sweepstakes ticket for a Broadway arcade
Heads you win, tails I lose
I'm rambling, I'm gambling
All upon a foggy night
Foggy night
Foggy night
Foggy night
You got the vice grips on my personality
It's all upon a foggy night
All upon a foggy night
All upon a foggy night
On a foggy night
All upon a foggy
All upon a foggy night

# On the Nickel

Sticks and stones will break my bones I always will be true
and when your mama's dead and gone I'll sing this lullaby just for you
and what becomes of all the little boys who never comb their hair
they're lined up all around the block on the nickel over there
so better bring a bucket there's a hole in the pail
and if you don't get my letter then you'll know that I'm in jail
and what becomes of all the little boys who never say their prayers
they're sleepin like a baby on the nickel over there
and if you chew tobacco and wish upon a star
you'll find out where the scarecrows sit just like punch lines between the cars
and I know a place where a royal flush can never beat a pair
and even Thomas Jefferson is on the nickel over there
so ring around the rosie sleepin in the rain
and you're always late for supper man you let me down let me down again
and I thought I heard a mockingbird Roosevelt knows where
you can skip the light with Grady Tuck on the nickel over there
so what becomes of all the little boys who run away from home
the world just keeps gettin bigger once you get out on your own
so here's to all the little boys the sandman takes you where
you're sleepin with a pillow man on the nickel over there
so climb up through that button hole and fall right up the stairs
and I'll show you where the short dogs grow on the nickel
over there

# On The Other Side Of The World

There's a blue eyed girl with a red bow tie
and a string of pearls with one good eye
in a rainy town the chimney smoke will curl
no one likes clowns on the other side of the world
and the children know she'll never let me go
there's a one legged priest that tangos with the farmers wife
Beauty and the beast is taking her own life
and a tear on a letter back home turns into a lake of your own
and a crow turns into a girl on the other side of the world
And she tastes like the sea and she's waiting for me
in the spring the weeds will show that he brought back the only rose
and he gave it to his girl on the other side of the world
and I drink champagne from your thin blue veins
She visits his grave wearing her mother's shawl
Should I shave or end it all
There's an old sailor song that the children know
their fingers curl 'round the other side of the world
on a bone white mare lost in Kathleen's hair
in the spring the weeds will show he brought back the only rose
and he gave it to his girl on the other side of the world

# On The Road

Well I left New York 
in nineteen forty-nine
to go across the country 
without a dad blamed dime
Montana in the cold cold fall
I found my father in a gambling hall
father father 
where have you been
I've been out in the world 
since I was only ten
father father 
where have you been
I've been out in the world 
since I was only ten
don't worry about me
about to die of pleurisy
cross the Mississippi
cross the Tennessee
cross the Niagara
home I'll never be
home in old Medora
home in ol' Truckee
Apalachicola
home I'll never be
for better or for worse
or thick and thin
I've been married to the little woman
god he loves me 
like I love him
I want you to do 
just the same for him
well the worms eat away
but don't worry
watch the wind
so I left Montana 
on an old freight train
the night my father died 
in the cold cold rain
rode to Opelousas 
rode to Wounded Knee
rode to Ogallala
home I'll never be
rode to Oklahoma 
rode to El Cajon
rode to old Tehatchapi
rode to San Antone
hey hey
rode to Opelousas 
rode to Wounded Knee
rode to Ogallala
home I'll never be
rode to Oklahoma 
rode to El Cajon
rode to old Tehatchapi
rode to San Antone
home I'll never be

# Once Upon a Town/Empty Packets

I wish I had a dollar
for each time I took a chance
on all those two-bit romeos
who counterfeit romance
somehow always thinking
of the last time I fell down
knowing that you fall in love
once upon a town

# The One That Got Away

The jigolo's jumpin salty 
ain't no trade out on the streets
half past the unlucky 
and the hawk's a front row seat
dressed in full orchestration 
stage door johnny's got to pay
and send him home 
talking bout the one that got away
could a been on easy street 
could a been a wheel
with irons in the fire 
and all them business deals
but the last of the big time losers 
shouted before he drove away
I'll be right back as soon as I crack 
the one that got away
the ambulance drivers don't give a shit 
they just want to get off work
and the short stop and the victim 
have already gone berserk
and the shroud tailor measures him 
for a deep six holiday
the stiff is froze, the case is closed 
on the one that got away
Jim Crow's directing traffic 
with them cemetery blues
with those peculiar looking trousers 
and them old Italian shoes
the wooden kimona was all ready 
to drop in San Francisco bay
but now he's mumbling something 
all about the one that got away
Costello was the champion 
at the St. Moritz Hotel
and the best this side of Fairfax 
reliable sources tell
but his reputation is at large 
and he's at Ben Frank's every day
waiting for the one that got away
he's got a snake skin sportshirt 
and he looks like Vincent Price
with a little piece of chicken 
and he's carving off a slice
but someone tipped her off 
she'll be doing a Houdini now any day
she shook his hustle 
the Greyhound bus'll 
take the one that got away
Andre is at the piano 
behind the Ivar in the Sewers
with a buck a shot for pop tunes 
and a fin for guided tours
he could of been in Casablanca 
he stood in line out there all day
but now he's spilling whiskey 
and learning songs about the one that got away
well I've lost my equilibrium 
my car keys and my pride
tattoo parlor's warm 
and so I huddle there inside
the grinding of the buzzsaw 
whatchuwanthathingtosay
just don't misspell her name 
buddy she's the one that got away

# Opening Montage: Tom's Piano Intro/Once Upon a Town/The Wages of Love

Down through the ages all of the sages
said don't spend your wages on love
it's graft and collusion about the intrusion
and preceding foreclosures there's overexposure
down at the crossroads the question is posed
bridge is washed out and the highway is closed
gotta have good reason to firmly believe
love was designed to exploit and deceive
there's an addendum wherever you send 'em
in your chest you will see
simple addition keeps with tradition
don't spend your wages on love
take any burgh any city or town
just get on main street and drive all the way down
you see love has a graveyard nurtured for those
that fell on their sabers and paid through the nose
your shovel's a shot glass dig your own hole
bury what's left of your miserable soul
down through the ages all of the sages
said don't spend your wages on love
it's graft and collusion about the intrusion
and preceding foreclosure there is overexposure
down at the crossroads the question is posed
and the bridge is washed out and the highway is closed

# The Part You Throw Away

You dance real slow
You wreck it down
You walk away, then you
turn around
What did that old blonde
gal say?
That is the part...
You throw away
I want that beggars eyes
a winning horse
a tidy Mexican divorce
St. Mary's prayers
Houdini's Hands
and a Barman who always
understands
Will you loose the flowers
hold on to the vase
Will you wipe all those teardrops
away from your face
I can't help thinking
as I close the door
I have done all of this
many times before
The bone must go
The wish can stay
The kiss don't know
What the lips will say
Forget I've hurt you
Put stones in your bed
and remember to never
mind instead
Well all of your letters
Burned up in the fire
Time is just memory
mixed in with Desire
That's not the road it is
Only the map...I say
gone just like matches
from a closed down cabaret
In a Portuguese Saloon
a fly is circling around
the room
You'll soon forget the
tune that you play
For that is the part
You throw away
oh that is the part
You throw away

# Pasties And A G-String

Smellin like a brewery 
lookin like a tramp
ain't got a quarter 
got a postage stamp
and a five o'clock shadow boxing 
all around the town
talking with the old men 
sleeping on the ground
Bazanti bootin
al zootin al hoot 
and Al Cohn
sharin this apartment 
with a telephone pole
and it's a fish net stockings 
spike heel shoes
strip tease, prick tease 
car kease blues
and the porno floor show 
live nude girls
dreamy and creamy 
and the brunette curls
chesty Morgan, and a 
Watermelon Rose
raise my rent and take off 
all your clothes
with the trench coats 
magazines bottle full a rum
she's so good, it make 
a dead man cum, with
pasties and a g-string 
beer and a shot
Portland through a shot glass 
and a Buffalo squeeze
wrinkles and cherry 
and twinky and pinky
and Fefe live from Gay Paree
fanfares rim shots 
backstage who cares
all this hot burlesque for me
cleavage cleavage thighs and hips
from the nape of her neck 
to the lips tick lips
chopped and channeled 
and lowered and louvered
and a cheater slicks 
and baby moons
she's hot and ready 
and creamy and sugared
and the band is awful 
and so are the tunes
crawlin on her belly shakin like jelly
and I'm gettin harder than 
Chinese algebraziers and cheers 
from the compendium here
hey sweet heart they're yellin for more
squashin out your cigarette butts 
on the floor
and I like Shelly 
you like Jane
what was the girl with the snake skins name
it's an early bird matinee' 
come back any day
getcha little sompin 
that cha can't get at home
getcha little sompin 
that cha can't get at home
pasties and a g-string 
beer and a shot
Portland through a shot glass 
and a Buffalo squeeze
popcorn front row 
higher than a kite
and I'll be back tomorrow night
and I'll be back tomorrow night

# Pay Me

They pay me not to come home
Keeping me stoned
I won’t run away
They say it’s easy to get
Stuck in this town
Just like Joan
You know I gave it all up for the stage
They fill my cup up in the cage
It’s nobody’s business but mine when I’m low
To hold yourself up is not a crime here you know
At the end of the world
I kick my foot at the lights
I breathe it in all night
There’s a light on a canvas tree
Money from home supporting me
They pay me not to come
I won’t eat crow
Ill stay away
And though all roads will not lead you home my girl
All roads lead to the end of the world
I sewed a little luck up in the hem of my gown
The only way down from the gallows is to swing
And I’ll wear boots instead of high heels
And the next stage that I am on it will have wheels

# The Piano Has Been Drinking, (Not Me)

The piano has been drinking 
my neck tie is asleep
and the combo went back to New York 
the jukebox has to take a leak
and the carpet needs a haircut 
and the spotlight looks like a prison break
cause the telephone is out of cigarettes 
and the balcony is on the make
and the piano has been drinking
the piano has been drinking
and the menus are all freezing
and the lightman's blind in one eye 
and he can't see out of the other
and the piano tuner's got a hearing aid 
and showed up with his mother
and the piano has been drinking
the piano has been drinking
cause the bouncer is a Sumo wrestler 
cream-puff casper milk toast
and the owner is a mental midget with the I.Q. of a fencepost
cause the piano has been drinking
the piano has been drinking
and you can't find your waitress 
with a Geiger counter
and she hates you and your friends 
and you just can't get served 
without her
and the box-office is drooling 
and the bar stools are on fire
and the newspapers were fooling 
and the ashtrays have retired
and the piano has been drinking
the piano has been drinking
the piano has been drinking
not me, not me, not me, not me, not me

# Picking Up After You

Here comes the bride and there goes the groom
looks like a hurricane went through this room
smells like a pool hall where's my other shoe
and I'm sick and tired of picking up after you
looks like you spent the night in a trench
and tell me how long have you been 
combing your hair with a wrench
the roses are dead and the violets are too
and I'm sick and tired of picking up after you
well I've told you before I won't tell you again
you don't defrost the icebox with a ball point pen
this railroad apartment is held together with glue
and I'm sick and tired of picking up after you
because I know I've been swindled 
I never bargained for this
what's more you never cared about me
why don't you get your own place 
so you can live like you do
and I'm sick and tired of picking up after you
take all your relatives and all of your shoes
believe me I'll really swing when you're gone
I'll be living on chicken and wine after we're through
with someone I pick up after you

# Picture In A Frame

Sun come up it was blue and gold
Sun come up it was blue and gold
Sun come up it was blue and gold
ever since I put your picture in a frame.
I come calling in my Sunday best
I come calling in my Sunday best
I come calling in my Sunday best
ever since I put your picture in a frame 
I'm gonna love you till the wheels come off
oh yea
I love you baby and I always will
I love you baby and I always will
I love you baby and I always will
ever since I put your picture in a frame

# Please Call Me, Baby

The evening fell just like a star
Left a trail behind
You spit as you slammed out the door
If this is love we're crazy
As we fight like cats and dogs
But I just know there's got to be more
So please call me, baby
Wherever you are
It's too cold to be out walking in the streets
We do crazy things when we're wounded
Everyone's a bit insane
I don't want you catching your death of cold
Out walking in the rain
I admit that I ain't no angel
I admit that I ain't no saint
I'm selfish and I'm cruel but you're blind
If I exorcise my devils
Well my angels may leave too
When they leave they're so hard to find
Please call me, baby
Wherever you are
It's too cold to be out walking in the streets
We do crazy things when we're wounded
Everyone's a bit insane
I don't want you catching your death of cold
Out walking in the rain
We're always at each other's throats
You know, it drives me up the wall(1)
Most of the time I'm just blowing off steam
And I wish to God you'd leave me
Baby, I wish to God you'd stay
Life's so different than it is in your dreams
Please call me, baby
Wherever you are
It's too cold to be out walking in the streets
We do crazy things when we're wounded
Everyone's a bit insane
I don't want you catching your death of cold
Out walking in the rain

# Please Wake Me Up

I put my chips on her shoulder
running in the carnival time
she bought the things that I told her
they made her eyes sparkle and shine
together we'll ring in the new year
I know that she'll be my queen
and if I fall asleep in your arms
please wake me up in my dreams
her out-fit was all made of vinyl
like nothing that I've ever seen
when our divorces are final
She'll fit right into my scheme
next to the pawnshop's a chapel
I'll show you just what I mean
and if I fall asleep in your arms

# The Pontiac

Well let's see 
we had the eh Fairlane
then the u-joints went out on that
and the bushings 
and then your mother wanted 
to trade it in on the Toronado
so we got the Toronado 
god I hated the color of that son of a bitch 
the dog destroyed the upholstery 
on the Ford 
boy that was long before you were born 
we called it the yellowbird 
two-door three on the tree
tight little mother 
threw a rod 
sold it to Jacobs 
for a hundred dollars
now the special eh
four-holer 
you've never seen body panels 
line up like that
overhead cam
dual exhaust
you know I had
let's see I had
four Buicks
loved 'em all
now your Uncle Emmet
well he drives a Thunderbird
it used to belong to your Aunt Evelyn
well she ruined it
drove it to Indiana 
with no gear oil
that was the end of that
sold that Cadillac to your mom 
your mom loved that Caddy
independent rear suspension
landau top
good tires
gas hog
I swear it had the power 
to repair itself
I loved the Olds 
Dan Steele used to give 'em to me at a discount
showroom models and that
and then there was the Pontiac and
god I loved that Pontiac
Well it was kind of an oxblood god
but It handled so beautifully
yeah I miss that car
well that was a long time ago
a long time ago
please wake me up in my dreams

# Pony

I've seen it all boys 
I've been all over
Been everywhere in the
whole wide world
I rode the high line
with old blind Darby
I danced real slow
with Ida Jane
I was full of wonder
when I left Murfreesboro
Now I am full of hollow
on Maxwell street
And I hope my Pony
I hope my Pony
I hope my Pony
knows the way back home
I walked from Natchez
to Hushpukena
I built a fire by the side
of the road
I worked for nothin in a 
Belzoni saw mill. I caught a
blind out on the B and O
Talullah's friendly Belzoni ain't so
A 44'll get you 99
And I hope my Pony
I hope my Pony 
I hope my Pony
Knows the way back home
I run my race with burnt face Jake
gave him a Manzanita cross
I lived on nothin
but dreams and train smoke
Somehow my watch and chain
got lost.
I wish I was home in Evelyn's Kitchen
with old Gyp curled around my feet
(Chorus)

# Poor Edward

Did you hear the news about Edward?
On the back of his head
He had another Face
Was it a woman's face
Or a young girl
They said to remove it would kill him
So poor Edward was doomed
The Face could laugh and cry
It was his Devil twin
And at night she spoke to him
Of things heard only in Hell
They were impossible to separate
Chained together for life
Finally the bell tolled his doom
He took a suite of rooms
And hung himself and her
From the balcony irons
Some still believe he was freed from her
But I knew her too well
I say she drove him to suicide
And took Poor Edward to Hell

# Poor Little Lamb

Poor little lamb 
now his fleece is all cold
wakes up in the morning alone
poor little lamb 
knows what's coming
life is an empty cup
poor little lamb
watch your shoulder
coyote's waiting out there
nobody will get any older
if we don't find a way out of here
so let's go on a bummer this summer
where we won't have to be afraid
the world will be on a hummer boys
and we'll laugh and we'll drink lemonade

# Potter's Field

Well you can buy me a drink and I'll tell you what I've seen
And I'll give you a bargain from the edge of a maniac's dream
That buys a black widow spider with a riddle in his yarn
That's clinging to the furrow of a blind man's brow
And I'll start talking from the brim of a thimble full of whiskey
On a train through the Bronx that will take you just as far
As the empty of a bottle to the highway of a scar
That stretched across the blacktop of my cheek like that
And then ducks beneath the brim of a fugitive's hat
You'll learn why liquor makes a stool pigeon rat on every face
That ever left a shadow down on Saint Mark's place
Hell I'd double-cross my mother if it was whiskey that they paid
And so an early bird says Nightstick's on the hit parade
And he ain't got a prayer and his days are numbered
And you'll track him down like a dog
But it's a tough customer you're getting in this trade
Cause the Nightstick's heart pumps lemonade
And whiskey keeps a blind man talking all right
And I'm the only one who knows just where he stayed last night
He was in a wrecking yard in a switchblade storm
In a wheelbarrow with nothing but revenge to keep him warm
And a half a million dollars in unmarked bills
Was the nightstick's blanket in a February chill
And the buzzards drove a crooked sky beneath a black wing halo
He was dealing high Chicago in the mud
And stacking the deck against a dragnet's eye
And the shivering nightstick in a miserable heap
With the siren for a lullaby singing him to sleep
And bleeding from a buttonhole and torn by a slug
Fired from the barrel of a two dollar gun
That scorched a blister on the grip of a punk by now
Is learning what you have to pay to be a hero anyhow
He dressed the hole in his gut with a hundred dollar bandage
A king's ransom for a bedspread that don't amount to nothing
Just cobweb strings on a busted ukulele
And the nightstick leaned on a black shillelagh
With the poison of a junkie's broken promise on his lip
He staggered in the shadows screaming I ain't never been afraid
And he shot out every street light on the promenade
Past the frozen ham and eggers at the penny arcade
Throwing out handfuls of a blood stained salary
They were dead in their tracks at the shooting gallery
And they fired off a twenty-one gun salute
And from the corner of his eye he caught the alabaster orbs
Of a dime a dance hall girl and stuffed a thousand dollar bill in her blouse
And caught the cruel and unusual punishment of her smile
And the nightstick winked beneath a rain soaked brim
Ain't no one seen hide nor hair of him since
No one except a spade on Riker's Island and me
So if you're mad enough to listen to a full of whiskey blind man
And you're mad enough to look beyond where the bloodhounds dare to go
And if you want to know where the nightstick's hiding out
You be down at the ferry landing oh let's say about half past a nightmare
When it's twisted on the clock and you tell them nickel sent you
Whiskey always makes him talk
And you ask for Captain Charon with the mud on his kicks
He's the skipper of the deadline steamer
And she sails from the Bronx across the river Styx
And a riddle is just a ticket for a dreamer
Cause when the weathervane is sleeping and the moon turns his back
You crawl on your belly along the railroad tracks
And cross your heart and hope to die and stick a needle in your eye
Cause he'd cut my bleeding heart out if he found out that I squealed
Cause you see a scarecrow is just a hoodlum
Who marked the cards that he dealed
And pulled a gypsy switch
Out on the edge of Potter's Field

# Putnam County

I guess things were always kind of quiet around Putnam County
Kind of shy and sleepy as it clung to the skirts of the two-lane
That was stretched out just like an asphalt dance floor
Where all the old-timers in bib jeans and store bought boots
Were hunkering down in the dirt
To lie about their lives and the places that they'd been
And they'd suck on Coca Colas, yeah, and be spitting Day's Work
Until the moon was a stray dog on the ridge and
And the taverns would be swollen until the naked eye of two a.m.
And the Stratocasters slung over the burgermeister beer guts
And swizzle-stick legs jackknifed over naugahyde stools... yeah
And the witch hazel spread out over the linoleum floors
And pedal-pushers stretched out over a midriff bulge
And the coiffed brunette curls over Maybelline eyes
Wearing Prince Machiavelli, or something yeah
Estee Lauder, smells so sweet
And I elbowed up at the counter with mixed feelings over mixed drinks
As Bubba and the Roadmasters moaned in pool hall concentration and
And knit their brows to cover the entire Hank Williams songbook
Whether you like it or not
And the old National register was singing to the tune of fifty-seven dollars and fifty-
seven cents yeah
And then it's last call, one more game of eight-ball
Berniece'd be putting the chairs on the tables
And someone come in and say, 'Hey man, anyone got any jumper cables?'
'Is that a 6 or a 12 volt, man? I don't know...'
Yeah, and all the studs in town would toss 'em down
And claim to fame as they stomped their feet
Yeah, boasting about being able to get more ass than a toilet seat
And the GMC's and the Straight-8 Fords were coughing and wheezing
And they percolated as they tossed the gravel underneath the fenders
To weave home a wet slick anaconda of a two-lane
With tire irons and crowbars a-rattling
With a tool box and a pony saddle
You're grinding gears and you're shifting into first
Yeah, and that goddamned tranny's just getting worse, man
With the melody of see-ya-laters and screwdrivers on carburetors
Talking shop about money to loan
And palominos and strawberry roans yeah
See ya tomorrow, hello to the Missus
With money to borrow and goodnight kisses
As the radio spit out Charlie Rich, man,
He sure can sing that son of a bitch
And you weave home, yeah, weaving home
Leaving the little joint winking in the dark warm narcotic American night
Beneath a pin cushion sky
And it's home to toast and honey, gotta start up the Ford, man
Yeah, and your lunch money's right over there on the draining board
And the toilet's running Christ, shake the handle
And the telephone is ringing, it's Mrs. Randall
And where the hell are my goddamned sandals?
What you mean, the dog chewed up my left foot?
With the porcelain poodles and the glass swans
Staring down from the knickknack shelf. yeah
And the parent's permission slips for the kids' field trips
Yeah, and a pair of mukluks scraping across the shag carpet yeah
And the impending squint of first light
And it lurked behind a weeping marquee in downtown Putnam
Yeah, and it'd be pulling up any minute now
Just like a bastard amber Velveeta yellow cab on a rainy corner
And be blowing its horn in every window in town

# Puttin' On The Dog

You gotta stomp whistle and scream
you gotta wake right up in your dreams

# Rain Dogs

Inside a broken clock
Splashing the wine 
With all the rain dogs
Taxi, we'd rather walk
Huddle a doorway with the Rain Dogs
For I am a Rain Dog, too
Oh, how we danced and we swallowed the night
For it was all ripe for dreaming
Oh, how we danced away 
All of the lights
We've always been out of our minds
The rum pours strong and thin
Beat out the dustman 
With the rain dogs
Aboard a shipwreck train
Give my umbrella to the Rain Dogs
For I am a Rain Dog too
Oh, how we danced with the 
Rose of Tralee
Her long hair black as a raven
Oh, how we danced and you 
Whispered to me
You'll never be going back home
You'll never be going back home
Oh, how we danced and we swallowed the night
For it was all ripe for dreaming
Oh, how we danced away 
All of the lights
We've always been out of our minds

# Rains On Me

This is how the world will be
everywhere I go it rains on me
forty monkeys drowning in a boiling sea
everywhere I go it rains on me
I went down into the valley to pray
everywhere I go it rains on me
I got drunk and I stayed all day
everywhere I go it rains on me
everywhere I go
everywhere I go
everywhere I go
it rains on me
All god's chilluns can't you see
everywhere I go it rains on me
Louie Lista and Marchese
everywhere I go it rains on me
Robert Sheehan and Paul Body
everywhere I go it rains on me
I went down to Argyle 
I went down to Dix
everywhere I go it rains on me
to get my powders and to get my fix
everywhere I go it rains on me
everywhere I go
everywhere I go
everywhere I go
it rains on me
everywhere I go
everywhere I go
everywhere I go

# Raised Right Men

There ain’t enough raised right men
It takes a raised right man to keep a happy hen
I said there ain’t enough raised right men
Heavens to murkatroid
Miners to coal
A good women can make a diamond out of a measly lump of coal
You need the patience of a glacier
If you can wait that long
Open up his window and admit it that you’re wrong
They’re ain’t enough raised right men
It takes raised right men to keep a happy hen
Mackey Debiasi
Was a complicated man
He quarreled with his woman
And she quarreled with her man
His head was just too thick
So she knocked out a tooth
He’s that lonely man on the Turnpike in the
Toll takers booth
They’re ain’t enough raised right men
Gunplay Maxwell and
Flat Nose George
Ice Pick Ed Newcomb
On a slab in the morgue
Flat Nose looked at Gunplay
And they all looked at me
With a good woman’s love we
Could have saved all three
And there ain’t enough raised right men
It takes raised right men to keep a happy hen
There ain’t enough raised right men

# Red Shoes By The Drugstore

She wore red shoes by the newsstand
as the rain splashed the nickel
and spilled like chablis all along the midway
theres a little bluejay
in a red dress on a sad night
one straw in a root beer
a compact with a cracked mirror
a bottle of evening in paris perfume
what's this sad tune
he told her to wait in by the magazines
to take care of some business it seems
bring a raincoat
bring a suitcase
bring your dark eyes
and wear those red shoes
theres a dark huddle at the bus stop
umbrellas arranged in a sad bouquet
lil Caesar got caught
he was going down to second
he was cooled
changing stations on the chamber
to steal a diamond ring
from a jewelry store for his baby
he loved the way she looked
in those red shoes
she waited by the drugstore
Caesar had never been this late before
the dogs bayed the moon
and rattled their chain
and the cold jingle of taps in a puddle
was the burglar alarm
snitchin on Caesar
the rain washes memories from the sidewalks
and the hounds splash the nickel full of soldiers
and Santa Claus is drunk
in the ski room
and it's Christmas Eve
in a sad café
when the moon gets it's way
there's a little blue jay by the news-stand
red shoes
red shoes
so meet me tonight by the drugstore
meet me tonight by the drugstore
meet me tonight by the drugstore
goin out tonight
goin out tonight
goin out tonight
wear your red shoes
red shoes
red shoes
red shoes
red shoes

# Reeperbahn

Round the curve of The Parrot Bar
A broken-down old movie star
Hustling and Easterner
Bringing out the beast in her
A high dive in a swimming pool
Filled with needles and with fools
The memories are short but the tales are long
Down there on the Reeperbahn
They called her Rosie when she was a girl
For her bright red cheeks and her strawberry curls
When she would laugh the river would run
She said she'd become a comedian
Oh what a pity, oh what a shame
When she said come calling, nobody came
Now her bright red cheeks are painted on
And she's laughing her head off in the Reeperbahn
Now little Hans was always strange
Wearing women's under things
His father beat him but he wouldn't change
He ran off with a man one day
Now his lingerie is all the rage
In the black on every page
His father proudly calls his name
Down there in the Reeperbahn
Now if you've lost your inheritance
And all you've left is common sense
And you're not too picky about the crowd you keep
Or the mattress where you sleep
Behind every window, behind every door
The apple is gone but there's always the core
The seeds will sprout up right through the floor
Down there in the Reeperbahn
Down there in the Reeperbahn

# The Return Of Jackie and Judy

# Road To Peace

Young Abdel Madi Shabneh was only 18 years old
the youngest of 9 children 
he'd never spent a night away from home
and his mother held his photograph 
up in the New York Times
you see the killing has intensified 
along the road to peace
a tall thin boy with a wispy moustache 
disguised as an Orthodox Jew
on a crowded bus in Jerusalem 
some had survived World War II
and the thunderous explosion 
blew out windows 200 yards away
more retribution and 17 dead
along the road to peace
now at King George Avenue and Jaffa Road 
passengers boarded bus 14A
in the aisle next to the driver Abdel Madi Shabneh
the last thing that he said on earth 
was God is great and God is good
and he blew them all to kingdom come
upon the road to peace
now in response to this 
another kiss of death was visited upon
Yashir Tehah Israel said is an 
Hamas Senior militant
Israel sent 4 choppers in
flames engulfed his white Opel
and it killed his wife and his 3-year-old child
leaving only blackened skeletons
they found a toddler's bottle 
and a pair of small shoes
and they waved them in front of the cameras
but Israel said they did not know that 
his wife and child were in the car
there are roadblocks everywhere 
and only suffering on TV
neither side will ever give up their smallest right
along the road to peace
Israel launched its latest campaign 
against Hamas on Tuesday
two days later Hamas shot back 
and killed five Israeli soldiers
though thousands dead and wounded on both sides
most of them Middle Eastern civilians
they fill their children full of hate 
to fight an old man's war and die
upon the road to peace
this is our land we will fight with all our force 
say the Palastinians and the Jews
and each side will cut off the hand of 
anyone who tries to stop the resistance
if the right eye offends thee
then you must pluck it out
And Machoud Abbas and Sharon had been lost
along the road to peace
once Kissinger said
we have no friends 
America only has interests
and now our president wants to be seen as a hero 
and he's hungry for re-election
Bush is reluctant to risk his future 
with the fear of his political failures
so he plays chess at his desk 
and poses for the press
ten thousand miles 
from the road to peace
in a video that they found 
at the home of Abdel Madi Shabneh
he held a Kalashnikov rifle
and he spoke with the voice like a boy
he was an excellent student
he studied so hard
it was as if he had a future
he told his mother 
he had a test that day
out along the road to peace
the fundamentalist killing on both sides 
is standing in the path of peace
and tell me 
why are we arming the Israeli army 
with guns and tanks and bullets
if God is great and God is good 
why can't he change the hearts of men
well maybe God himself 
is lost and needs help
maybe God himself 
he needs all of our help
maybe God himself 
is lost and needs help
he's out upon the road to peace
maybe God himself is lost and needs help
maybe God himself he needs all of our help
and he's lost upon the road to peace
and he's lost upon the road to peace
out upon the road to peace

# Romeo Is Bleeding

Romeo is bleeding but not so as you'd notice
he's over on 18th Street as usual
looking so hard against the hood of his car
puttin' out a cigarette in his hand
and for all the Pachucos at the pumps
at Romero's Paint and Body
they all seein' how far they can spit
well it was just another night
and now they're huddled in the brake lights
of a '58 Bel Air
and listenin' how Romeo
killed a sheriff with his knife
and they all jump when they hear the sirens
but Romeo just laughs
all the racket in the world
ain't never gonna save that copper's ass
he ain't never gonna see another summertime
for gunnin' down my brother
and leavin him like a dog
beneath a car without his knife
Romeo says: hey man gimme a cigarette
and they all reach for their pack
and Frankie lights it for him
and pats him on the back
and throws a bottle at a milk truck
and as it breaks he grabs his nuts
they all know they could be just like Romeo
if they only had the guts
Romeo is bleeding but nobody can tell
sings along with the radio
with a bullet in his chest
and he combs back his fenders
and they all agree it's clear
and that everything is cool
now that Romeo's here
Romeo is bleeding
he winces now and then
he leans against the car door
feels the blood in his shoes
and someone's cryin' at the 5 Points
in the phone booth by the store
Romeo starts his engines
wipes the blood of the door
And he brodies through the signal
with the radio full blast
leavin' the boys there hikin' up their chinos
and then they all try to stand like Romeo
beneath the moon cut like a sickle
and they're talkin' now in Spanish
all about their hero
Romeo is bleeding
as he gives the man his ticket
he climbs the balcony at the movies
and he'll die without a whimper
like every heroes dream
like an angel with a bullet
and Cagney on the screen
And Romeo is bleeding
Romeo is bleeding hey man
Romeo is bleeding hey man
Romeo is bleeding hey man
Romeo is bleeding

# Rosie

Well, I'm sitting on a windowsill, blowing my horn
Nobody's up except the moon and me
And a lazy old tomcat on a midnight spree
And all that you left me was a melody
Rosie, why do you evade me?
Rosie, how can I persuade thee?
Rosie
And the moon's all up, full and big
Apricot tips in an indigo sky
And I've been loving you, Rosa, since the day I was born
And I'll love you, Rosie, 'til the day I die
Rosie, why do you evade me?
Rosie, how can I persuade thee?
Rosie
Rosie, why do you evade me?
Rosie, how can I persuade thee?
Rosie
And I'm sitting on a windowsill, blowing my horn
Nobody's up except the moon and me
And a lazy old tomcat on a midnight spree
All that you left me was a melody
Rosie, why do you evade me?
Rosie, how can I persuade thee?
Rosie

# Ruby's Arms

I will leave behind all of my clothes I wore when I was with you
all I needs my railroad boots and my leather jacket
as I say goodbye to Ruby's arms although my heart is breaking
I will steal away out through your blinds for soon you will be waking
the morning light has washed your face and everything is turning blue now
hold on to your pillow case there's nothing I can do now
as I say goodbye to Ruby's arms you'll find another soldier
and I swear to god by Christmas time there'll be someone else to hold you
the only thing I'm taking is the scarf off of your clothesline
I'll hurry past your chest of drawers and your broken wind chimes
as I say goodbye I say goodbye I say goodbye to Ruby's arms
I will feel my way down the darkened hall and out into the morning
the hobos at the freight yards have kept their fires burning
so Jesus Christ this goddamn rain will someone put me on a train
I'll never kiss your lips again or break your heart
As I say goodbye I say goodbye I say goodbye to Ruby's arms

# San Diego Serenade

I never saw the morning 'til I stayed up all night
I never saw the sunshine 'til you turned out the light
I never saw my hometown until I stayed away too long
I never heard the melody until I needed the song
I never saw the white line 'til I was leaving you behind
I never knew I needed you until I was caught up in a bind now
I never spoke "I love you" 'til I cursed you in vain
I never felt my heart strings until I nearly went insane
I never saw the east coast until I moved to the west
I never saw the moonlight until it shone off of your breast
I never saw your heart until someone tried to steal, tried to steal it away
I never saw your tears until they rolled down your face
I never saw the morning 'til I stayed up all night
I never saw the sunshine 'til you turned out your love light, baby
I never saw my hometown 'til I stayed away too long
I never heard the melody until I needed the song

# Satisfied

When I’m gone
When I’m gone
Roll my vertebrae out like dice
Let my skull be a home for the mice
Let me bleach like the bones on a beach
I’ll be hard like a pit from a peach
Now the ground has a branch
Now the hound has a ranch
The old tressel’s just junk
The Edsel is on blocks
The old said so… won’t talk
I’m a blimp that’s straining, cut’er ties
I’m a moth in training, flutter by
Huh…
When I’m gone
When I’m gone
I said I will have satisfaction
I will be satisfied
I said I will be satisfied
When I’m believing: satisfaction
When I’m grieving: satisfaction
When I’m shaking: satisfaction
When I’m praying: satisfaction
When I’m staying: satisfaction
When I’m carousing
When I’m a thousand
I said I will have satisfaction
I will be satisfied
Before I’m gone
Before I’m gone
I will have satisfaction
I will be satisfied
I will have satisfaction
I will be satisfied
Now Mr. Jagger and Mr. Richards
I will scratch where I’ve been itching
Now Mr. Jagger and Mr. Richards
I will scratch where I’ve been itching
Before I’m gone
Before I’m gone
Before I’m gone
Before I’m gone
Let me go back into the barrel
Let the bullet go back into the barrel
Let the bullet go back into the barrel
Let the bullet go back into the barrel
Before I’m gone
Before I’m gone
I said I will have satisfaction
Let the bullet go back into the barrel
Let the bullet go back into the barrel
Take a left off the straight and the narrow
Let the bullet go back into the barrel
Before I’m gone
Before I’m gone

# Saving All My Love for You

It's too early for the circus it's too late for the bars
everyones sleepin but the paperboys
and no one in this town is makin any noise
but the dogs and the milkmen and me
the girls around here all look like Cadillacs
and no one likes a stranger here
I'd come home but I'm afraid that you won't take me back
but I'd trade off everything just to have you near
I know I'm irresponsible and I don't behave
and I ruin everything that I do
and I'll probably get arrested when I'm in my grave
but I'll be savin all my love for you
I paid fifteen dollars for a prostitute
with too much makeup and a broken shoe
but her eyes were just a counterfeit she tried to gyp me out of it
but you know that I'm still in love with you
don't listen to the rumors that you hear about me
cause I ain't half as bad as they make me out to be
well I may lose my mind but baby can't you see
that I'll be savin all my love for you

# Sea Of Love

# Semi Suite

Well, you hate those diesels rolling
Those Friday nights out bowling
When he's off for a twelve-hour lay over night
You wish you had a dollar
For every time he hollered
That he's leaving and he's never coming back
But the curtain-laced billow
And his hands on your pillow
And his trousers are hanging on the chair
You're lying through your pain, babe
But you're gonna tell him he's your man
And you ain't got the courage to leave
He tells you that you're on his mind
You're the only one he's ever gonna find that's
Kind of special, and understands his complicated soul
But the only place a man can breathe
And collect his thoughts is
Midnight and flying away on the road
But you've packed and unpacked
So many times you've lost track
And the steam heat is dripping off the walls
But when you hear his engines
You're looking through the window in the kitchen and you know
You're always gonna be there when he calls
Cause he's a truck driving man, stopping when he can
He's a truck driving man, stopping when he can

# Shake It

Strip Poker Motel
Got a small blue tail
Hot ice, cold cash
I never been no good at
Staying out of jail
Wheel spin, roulette
Who's giving, don't get
Ripped shirt, black eye
Tuxedo, bow tie
Dark sound, straight road
Get lost, get loaded
Enlisted men, off duty
Stolen clouds, dark beauty
Cold gun, wild rose
Night clerk, door closed
Lie down baby 
Your love is a faucet
ahhhh
Called China, cell phone
Chun King, not home
You know I feel like a 
Preacher waving a gun around
Shake it 
Shake it 
Shake it baby
Shake it 
Shake it 
Shake it now
Shake it 
Shake it 
Shake it baby
Shake it 
Shake it 
Shake it now
Outside, it's damp
Put a towel on that lamp
You look hot in this 
Light
I can love you all night
Shoes off, hair down
Got a pink night gown
Mike Tyson, KO'ed 
On the wild, blue road
Small town, straight road
That rooster, done crowed
Flat tire, homemade cross
You know I feel like a 
Preacher waving a gun around
Shake it 
Shake it 
Shake it baby
Shake it 
Shake it 
Shake it now
Shake it 
Shake it 
Shake it baby
Shake it 
Shake it 
Shake it now

# Shiny Things

The things a crow puts in his nest
they are always things he finds that shine best
somehow he'll find
a shiny dime
a silver twine
from a valentine
the crows all bring
them shiny things
leave me alone you big old moon
the light you cast is just a liar
you're like the crows
cause if it glows
you're dressed to go
you guessed I know
you'll always bring
them shiny things
well I'm not dancing here tonight
but things are bound to turn around
the only thing
I want that shines
is to be king
there in your eyes
to be your only
shiny thing

# Shiver Me Timbers

I'm leaving my family, I'm leaving all my friends
My body's at home, but my heart's in the wind
Where the clouds are like headlines on a new front-page sky
My tears are salt water, and the moon's full and high
And I know Martin Eden's gonna be proud of me now
And many before me, who've been called by the sea
To be up in the crow's nest, and singing my say
Shiver me timbers, cause I'm a-sailing away
And the fog's lifting, and the sand's shifting, and I'm drifting on out
Old Captain Ahab, he ain't got nothing on me now
So swallow me, don't follow me, I'm traveling alone
Blue water's my daughter, and I'm gonna skip like a stone
So please call my missus, gotta tell her not to cry now
'Cause my goodbye is written by the moon in the sky
Hey, and nobody knows me, I can't fathom my staying
And shiver me timbers, cause I'm a-sailing away
And the fog's lifting, and the sand's shifting, and I'm drifting on out
And old Captain Ahab, he ain't got nothing on me
So come and swallow me, follow me, I'm traveling alone
Blue water's my daughter, I'm gonna skip like a stone
And I'm leaving my family, I'm leaving all my friends
My body's at home, but my heart's in the wind
Where the clouds are like headlines upon a new front-page sky
And shiver me timbers, 'cause I'm a-sailing away

# Shore Leave

Well with buck shot eyes and a purple heart
I rolled down the national stroll
and with a big fat paycheck 
strapped to my hip-sack
and a shore leave wristwatch underneath my sleeve
in a Hong Kong drizzle on Cuban heels
I rowed down the gutter to the Blood Bank
and I'd left all my papers on the Ticonderoga
and I was in bad need of a shave
and so I slopped at the corner on cold chow mein
and shot billiards with a midget 
until the rain stopped
and I bought a long sleeved shirt 
with horses on the front
and some gum and a lighter and a knife
and a new deck of cards (with girls on the back)
and I sat down and wrote a letter to my wife
and I said Baby, I'm so far away from home
and I miss my baby so
I can't make it by myself
I love you so
Well I was pacing myself 
trying to make it all last
squeezing all the life 
out of a lousy two day pass
and I had a cold one at the Dragon 
with some Filipino floor show
and talked baseball with a lieutenant 
over a Singapore sling
and I wondered how the same moon outside 
over this Chinatown fair
could look down on Illinois 
and find you there
and you know I love you Baby
and I'm so far away from home
and I miss my baby so
I can't make it by myself
I love you so
Shore Leave...
Shore Leave...

# Singapore

We sail tonight for Singapore 
We're all as mad as hatters here
I've fallen for a tawny moor
took off to the Land of Nod
Drank with all the Chinamen
Walked the sewers of Paris
I danced along a colored wind
Dangled from a rope of sand
You must say goodbye to me
We sail tonight for Singapore
Don't fall asleep while you're ashore
Cross your heart and hope to die
When you hear the children cry
Let marrow bone and cleaver choose
While making feet for children's shoes
Through the alley 
Back from Hell
When you hear that steeple bell
You must say goodbye to me.
Wipe him down with gasoline 
Till his arms are hard and mean
From now on boys this iron boat's your home
So heave away boys
We sail tonight for Singapore 
Take your blankets from the floor
Wash your mouth out by the door 
The whole town is made of iron ore
Every witness turns to steam 
They all become Italian dreams
Fill your pockets up with earth
Get yourself a dollar's worth
Away boys, away boys, heave away
The captain is a one-armed dwarf
He's throwing dice along the wharf
In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is King
So take this ring
We sail tonight for Singapore 
We're all as mad as hatters here
I've fallen for a tawny moor
took off to the Land of Nod
Drank with all the Chinamen
Walked the sewers of Paris
I danced along a colored wind
Dangled from a rope of sand
You must say goodbye to me

# Sins Of My Father

God said don't give me your
Tin horn prayers
Don't buy roses off the street down there
Took it all and took the dirt road home
Dreaming of Jenny with the light brown hair
Night is falling like a bloody axe
Lies and rumors and the wind at my back
Hand on the wheel gravel on the road
Will the pawn shop sell me back what I sold
I'm gonna take the sins of my father
I'm gonna take the sins of my mother
I'm gonna take the sins of my brother
Down to the pond
Birds cry warning from a hidden branch
Carving out a future with a gun and an axe
I'm way beyond the gavel and the laws of man
Still living in the palm of the grace of your hand
The worlds not easy the blind man said
Turns on nothing but money and dread
Dogs been scratching at the door all nite
Long neck birds flying out of the moon light
I'm gonna take the sins of my father
I'm gonna take the sins of my mother
I'm gonna take the sins of my brother
Down to the pond
Smack dab in the middle of a dirty lie
The star spangled glitter of his one good eye
Everybody knows that the game was rigged
Justice wears suspenders and a powdered wig
Dark town alleys been hiding you
Long bell tolling is your waterloo
Oh baby what can you do
Does the light of god blind you
Or lead the way home for you?
I'm gonna take the sins of my father
I'm gonna take the sins of my mother
I'm gonna take the sins of my brother
Down to the pond
God all mighty for righteousness sake
Humiliation of our fallen state
Written in the book of tubold Cain
A long black over coat will show no stain
Feel the heat and the burn on your back
The rip and the moan and the stretch of the rack
All my belongings in a flour sack
Will the place I come from
Take me back
I'm gonna take the sins of my father
I'm gonna take the sins of my mother
I'm gonna take the sins of my brother
Down to the pond
They'll hang me in the morning on a scaffold yea big
To dance upon nothing to the tyborn jig
Treats you like a puppet when your under its spell
Oh the heart is heaven
But the mind is hell
Jesus of Nazareth told Mike of the weeds
I's born at this time for a reason you see
When I'm dead I'll be dead a long time
But the wines so pleasing and so sublime
I'm gonna take the sins of my father
I'm gonna take the sins of my mother
I'm gonna take the sins of my brother
Down to the pond
Kissed my sweetheart by the chinaball tree
Everything I done is between God and me
Only he will judge how my time was spent
29 days of sinning and 40 to repent
the horse is steady but the horse is blind
wicked are the branches on the tree of mankind
the roots grow upward and the branches grow down
its much too late to throw the dice again I've found
I'm gonna take the sins of my father
I'm gonna take the sins of my mother
I'm gonna take the sins of my brother
Down to the pond
I'm gonna wash them
I'm gonna wash them
I'm gonna wash the sins of my Father
I'm gonna wash the sins of my Mother
I'm gonna wash the sins of my Brother
Till the water runs clear
Till the water runs clear

# Sixteen Shells From A Thirty-Ought-Six

Plugged sixteen shells from a thirty-ought six
And a black crow snuck through a hole in the sky
And I spent all my buttons on an old pack mule
And I made me a ladder from a pawn shop marimba
I leaned it all up against a dandelion tree
I leaned it all up against a dandelion tree
Gonna whittle you into kindlin'
Sixteen shells from a thirty-ought six
Whittle you into kindlin'
Sixteen shells from a thirty-ought six
Now I slept in the holler of a dry creek bed
And I tore out the buckets from a red corvette
Tore out the buckets from a red corvette
Lionel and Dave and the Butcher made three
Meet me by the knuckles of the skinnybone tree
With the strings of a Washburn like a clothes line
Now me and that mule scrambled right through the hole
Me and that mule scrambled right through the hole
Whittle you into kindlin'
Sixteen shells from a thirty-ought six
Whittle you into kindlin'
Sixteen shells from a thirty-ought six
I will whittle you into kindlin'
Sixteen shells from a thirty-ought six
Whittle you into kindlin'
Sixteen shells from a thirty-ought six
Gonna take a 38 hours long gone train
I just Long gone train
Just long gone train
I just long
Long

# Small Change

Well small change got rained on with his own .38
and nobody flinched down by the arcade
and the marquise weren't weeping 
they went stark ravin' mad
and the cabbies were the only ones 
that really had it made
cause his cold trousers were twisted 
and the sirens high and shrill
and crumpled in his fist was a five dollar bill
and the naked mannikins with their 
cheshire grins
and the raconteurs 
and roustabouts said buddy 
come on in 
cause the dreams ain't broken down here 
now... they're walkin' with a limp
now that 
small change got rained on with his own .38
and nobody flinched down by the arcade
and the burglar alarm's been disconnected 
and the newsmen start to rattle
and the cops are tellin' jokes about some whore house in Seattle
and the fire hydrants plead the 5th Amendment
and the furniture's bargains galore
but the blood is by the juke box 
on an old linoleum floor
and it's a hot rain on 42nd Street 
and now the umbrellas ain't got a chance
and the newsboy's a lunatic 
with stains on his pants cause...
small change got rained on with his own .38
and no one's gone over to close his eyes
and there's a racing form in his pocket 
circled Blue Boots in the 3rd
and the cashier at the clothing store 
he didn't say a word as the
siren tears the night in half 
and someone lost his wallet
well it's surveillance of assailants 
if that's whachawannacallit
but the whores still smear on
and they all look like
but their mouths cut just like 
razor blades and their eyes are like stilettos
and her radiator's steaming 
and her teeth are in a wreck
now she won't let you kiss her 
but what the hell did you expect
and the gypsies are tragic and if you 
wanna to buy perfume, well 
they'll bark you down like 
carneys...sell you Christmas cards in June
but...
small change got rained on with his own .38
and his headstone's 
a gumball machine
no more chewing gum or 
baseball cards or 
overcoats or dreams and
someone is hosing down the sidewalk 
and he's only in his teens
small change got rained on with his own .38
and a fist full of dollars can't change that
and someone copped his watch fob 
and someone got his ring
and the newsboy got his pork pie Stetson hat
and the tuberculosis old men 
at the Nelson wheeze and cough
and someone will head South 
until this whole thing cools off cause
small change got rained on with his own .38
small change got rained on with his own .38

# Soldier's Things

Davenports and kettle drums 
and swallow-tail coats
table cloths and patent leather shoes
bathing suits and bowling balls 
and clarinets and rings
and all this radio really 
needs is a fuse
a tinker, a tailor 
a soldier's things
his rifle, his boots full of rocks
and this one is for bravery
and this one is for me
and everything's a dollar 
in this box
Cuff links and hub caps 
trophies and paperbacks
it's good transportation 
but the brakes aren't so hot
necktie and boxing gloves 
this jackknife is rusted
you can pound that dent out 
on the hood
a tinker, a tailor 
a soldier's things
his rifle, his boots full of rocks
oh, and this one is for bravery
and this one is for me
and everything's a dollar 
in this box

# Somewhere

Theres a place for us
somewhere a place for us
peace and quiet and open air
wait for us somewhere
There's a time for us
Someday a time for us
Time together a time to spare
Time to learn and time to care
Someday somewhere
We'll find a new way of living
We'll find a way of forgiving
Somewhere
Theres a place for us
A time and a place for us
Hold my hand and we're halfway there
Hold my hand and I'll take you there
Somehow someday somewhere

# Spare Parts 1 (A Nocturnal Emission)

Well, the dawn cracked hard just like a bullwhip
Cause it wasn't taking no lip from the night before
And it shook out the streets, as the stew bums showed up
Like bounced checks, rubbing their necks
And the sky turned the color of Pepto-Bismol
Yeah, and the parking lots growled
My old sport coat full of promissory notes
And a receipt from a late night motel
The hawk had his whole family out there in the wind
And he got a message for you to beware
Kicking your ass in, in a cold-blooded fashion
And dishing out more than a good man can bear
And I got shoes untied, my shirttail is out
Ain't got a ghost of a chance with this old romance
Just an apartment for rent down the block
Ivar Theater with live burlesque
Man, the manager's scowling, with his feet on the desk
Boom boom against the curtain, you're still hurting, ay-ay
And then push came to shove, and shove came to biff
Girls like that just lay you out stiff
Maybe I'll go to Cleveland and, you know, get me a tattoo or something
My brother-in-law lives there
And it's a skid mark tattoo on the asphalt blue
Was that a Malibu?
Vroooooom, vroooooom
Yeah, it's Liz Taylor and Montgomery Clift
Coming on to the broads with the same old riff, yeah
'Hey baby, why don't you come up to my place?
We'll listen to some smooth music on the stereo' eh-he-he'
'No thank you,' she said, eh-he-he, 'you got any Stan Getz records?'
'No man, I got eh... Smothers Brothers'
So I combed back my Detroit, jacked up my pegs
I wiped my Stacy Adams' and I jackknifed my legs
Yeah, I got designs on a moving violation
Yeah baby, you put me on hold and I'm out in the wind
And it's getting mighty cold
It's colder than a gut-shot bitch wolf dog with nine sucking pups
pulling a number-four trap up a hill in the dead of winter
In the middle of a snowstorm with a mouth full of porcupine quills
Well, I don't need you, baby
You see, it's a well known fact, you know
I'm four sheets to the wind, I'm glad you're gone
I'm glad you're gone, cause I'm finally alone
Glad you're gone, but I wish you'd come home
Yeah, and I struggled out of bed
Cause the dawn was cracking hard just like a bullwhip
And it wasn't taking no lip from the night before
Yeah, as it shook out the streets and the stew bums showed up
Just like bounced checks, rubbing their necks
And the sky turned the color of Pepto-Bismol
And my old sport coat full of promissory notes
And the hawk had his whole family out there in the wind
He got a message for you to beware
Kicking your ass in, in a cold blooded fashion
He'll be dishing out more than a good man can bear
Well let's take it to Bakersfield, get a little apartment somewhere

# Spare Parts II and Closing

I want to thank you all very much for coming this evening. It really made my
night. It would have been real strange here if nobody would have showed up
I'd like to introduce my group this evening and it's been a real preasure
A preasure and a plivilege to work with these gentlemen
I'd like to introduce
Please give a warm round of applause for Michael Melvoin on piano!
On saxophone, Pete Christlieb
On bass, Jim Hughart
And on drums, Bill Goodwin
Yeah 
They all come from good families, but over the years they just
Kind of individually developed some ways about them that just aren't right
You know
I was real pleased 
I noticed everybody coming in this evening you're all
Decked out in full regalia and everything and I appreciate you getting
Dressed up for an affair such as this. You know, I think it's something that
I've always tried to be as concerned about as possible and somebody said
To me one day 'Christ, Waits! You look so goddamned raggedy, why don't you get
Yourself something to wear, you know?'
I said, 'Yeah well, not a bad idea' Maybe a serious seersucker saturday
evening cranberry accoutrement ensemble would be nice. So I went down to
Zeider & Zeider and I said, 'I want something sharp!' I said, 'I'm kind of in the
market, in the neighborhood of something like maybe some green gabardines
with bonnaroo britches. And a leviticously deuteronomous sort of catastrophic
lunchbox Stetson, you know. I'd like to get some danger high-voltage
slacks, with high top, mid-noon, brushed suede penny loafers, so I can be
passing out wolf tickets regardless of where I go.' Walk into the Twenty-Grand
Club... And the Soul & Inspirations are playing Yeah, and you're cutting a
rug and pulling on a coat and emoting. Band is kicking into some long
version of 'Harlem Nocturne' or something You get designs on a girl in the corner 
You say, 'Say baby... live around here?'
Yeah... I think I'm gonna plant you now and I'm gonna dig you later
Make like a bakery truck and haul buns 
Make like a hockey player and get the puck out of here
I gotta go see a man about a dog
I'll see you later
Thank you very much for coming this evening

# Spidey's Wild Ride

The smoke from the battle fish 
and the rain soaked through
and the wheelman left the shore
and barns tumbled and silos flew 
across fifteen miles of bad road tar
and Big Bull Trometer hung on to the side
and the pig dogs trembled on Spidey's wild ride
and Big John Jizzum from downtown Chisolm
flew away with old Mrs. Storm
and they found Bird Lundy 'neath a keg of nails
crooked as a dog's hind leg
keeping warm after twenty-nine days 
on hard assed bread
he drilled to the big outside 
and clung like a tick to his waterfront
life mooned and clouded blued and skied
and all the clocks blew up on Spidey's wild ride
and the hills stood up in a great big three
and left me whipped by the forces that were inside me
loud as the ocean cold as a desk 
red as the water on the river of flesh
and he was sewing up his pants while he was shoeing a mule
and he was bucking a head wind gale
but the crooked ass beauty was trapped to the side
and he shook on Spidey's wild ride
and all the statue ass makers and the uprooted trees
and I shouted way up to where the rabbit digs his hole
and the wheelman the jockeys the landlords and thee
were bucking a head wind south
and with nine lives spent he landed on his rent
composed with a steelhead salmon in his mouth
and I never did see another day outside
cause I'd had enough travel on Spidey's wild ride

# Starving In The Belly Of A Whale

Life is whittled
Life's a riddle
Man's a fiddle that life plays on
When the day breaks, and the earth quakes
Life's a mistake all day long
Tell me, who gives a good goddamn
You'll never get out alive
Don't go dreaming
Don't go scheming
A man must test his mettle
In a crooked ol' world
Starving in the Belly
Starving in the Belly
Starving in the Belly of a whale
Starving in the belly
Starving in the belly
Starving in the belly of a whale
Don't take my word
Just look skyward
They that dance must pay the fiddler
Sky is darkening
Dogs are barking
But the caravan moves on
Tell me who gives a good goddamn
You'll never get get out alive
Don't go dreaming
Don't go scheming
A man must test his mettle
In crooked ol world
Starving in the Belly...
(Chorus)
As the crow flies
It's there the truth lies
At the bottom of the well
E-o-leven goes to heaven
Bless the dead here as the rain falls
Don't trust a bull's horn
A doberman's tooth
A runaway horse or me
Don't be greedy, don't be needy
If you live in hope you're
Dancing to a terrible tune
Starving in the Belly,
Starving in the Belly...

# Story

Once upon a time there was a poor child
with no father and no mother
and everything was dead
and no one was left in the whole world
everything was dead
and the child went on search day and night
and since nobody was left on the earth
he wanted to go up into the heavens
and the moon was looking at him so friendly
and when he finally got to the moon
the moon was a piece of rotten wood
and then he went to the sun
and when he got there 
the sun was a wilted sunflower
and when he got to the stars
they were little golden flies
stuck up there like the shrike 
sticks 'em on a blackthorn
And when he wanted to go back down to earth
the earth was an overturned piss pot
And he was all alone 
he sat down and he cried
and he is there till this day
all alone
okay there's your story
night night

Whoa, how about that band? Whoa!

# Strange Weather

Will you take me across the channel
London Bridge is falling down
Strange a woman tries to save
More than a man will try to drown
And it's the rain that they predicted
It's the forecast every time
The rose has died because you picked it
I believe that brandy's mine
And all over the world
Strangers talk only about the weather
All over the world 
It's the same
It's the same
And the world is getting flatter
And the sky is falling all around
Oh and nothing is the matter
For I'll never cry in town
And a love like ours my dear
Is best measured when it's down
And I never buy umbrellas
Cause there's always one around
And all over the world
Strangers talk only about the weather
All over the world 
It's the same
It's the same
And you know that it's the beginning
And you know that it's the end
Once again we are strangers
As the fog goes rolling in
And all over the world
Strangers talk only about the weather
All over the world 
It's the same
It's the same
It's the same

# Such A Scream

Well pale face said
To the eyeball kid
She just goes clank and boom and steam
A halo, wings, horns and a tail
Shoveling coal inside my dreams
There are no laws
She's made of cream
She's such a scream
Qui bon tres bien, nails in cement
A Donnie gal from mortal clay
The plow is red
The well is full, inside 
The dollhouse of her skull
A cheetah coat fills up with steam
She's such a scream
All crooked lines
Her fireplace
A milktrain so clean
Machine gun haste
You'll ride the only wall of shame
And drag that chain across the state
Her lips are red
She is the queen
She's such a scream...

# Swordfishtrombone

Well, he came home from the war 
with a party in his head
and modified Brougham DeVille
and a pair of legs that opened up 
like butterfly wings
and a mad dog that wouldn't 
sit still
he went and took up with a Salvation Army 
Band girl
who played dirty water 
on a swordfishtrombone
he went to sleep at the bottom of 
Tenkiller lake
and he said "gee, but it's great to be home"
Well he came home from the war 
with a party in his head
and an idea for a fireworks display
and he knew that he'd be ready with 
a stainless steel machete
and a half a pint of Ballantine's 
each day
And he holed up in room above a hardware store
cryin' nothing there but Hollywood tears
and he put a spell on some 
poor little Crutchfield girl
and stayed like that for 27 years
Well he packed up all his 
expectations he lit out for California
with a flyswatter banjo on his knee
with lucky tiger in his angel hair 
and benzedrine for getting there
they found him in a eucalyptus tree
lieutenant got him a canary bird 
and skanked her head with every word
And Chesterfield moonbeams in a song
and he got 20 years for lovin' her 
from some Oklahoma governor
said everything this Doughboy 
does is wrong
Now some say he's doing 
the obituary mambo
and some say he's hanging on the wall
perhaps this yarn's the only thing 
that holds this man together
some say he was never here at all
Some say they saw him down in 
Birmingham, sleeping in a boxcar going by
and if you think that you can tell a bigger tale
I swear to God you'd have to tell a lie...

# T'Ain't No Sin

When you hear sweet syncopation
And the music softly moans
T ain't no sin to take off your skin 
And dance around in your bones
When it gets too hot for comfort
And you can't get an ice cream cone
'T ain't no sin to take off your skin
And dance around in your bones
Just like those bamboo babies
Down in the South Sea tropic zone
T' ain't no sin to take off your skin
And dance around in your bones
When you hear sweet syncopation, and the music softly moans
't ain't no sin to take off your skin, and dance around in your bones
When it gets too hot for comfort, and you can't get an ice cream cone
't ain't no sin to take off your skin, and dance around in your bones
Just like those bamboo babies, down in the South Sea tropic zone
't ain't no sin to take off your skin, and dance around in your bones

# Table Top Joe

Well, my Mama didn't want me
On the day I was born
Born without a body
I got nothin' but scorn
But I always loved music
All I had was my hands
And I dreamed I'd be famous
And I'd work at The Sands
Tabletop Joe Tabletop Joe
Everyone knows Tabletop Joe
I had trouble with the pedals
But I had a strong left hand
And I could play Stravinsky
On a baby grand
I said I'm gonna join the circus
'cause that's where I belong
And I went to Coney Island
Singing this song
Tabletop Joe Tabletop Joe
Everyone knows Tabletop Joe
And they gave me top billing
In the Dreamland show
I had my own orchestra
Starring Tabletop Joe
And the man without a body
Proved everyone wrong
I was rich and I was famous
And I was where I belonged
Singing Tabletop Joe
Tabletop Joe
Everyone knows Tabletop Joe

# Take Care Of All My Children

Oh take care of all my children
don't let them wander and roam
take care of all of my children
for I don't know when I'm comin' back home
you can put all of my possessions here in Jesus' name
nail a sign on the door
bright and early Sunday morning 
with my walking cane
I'm going up to see my lord
oh keep them together at the sundown
safe from the devil's hand
you gotta make them a pillow 
on the hard ground
I'll be going up to Beaulah land
you can put all of my possessions here in Jesus' name
nail a sign on the door
bright and early Sunday morning 
with my walking cane
I'm going up to see my lord
remember you never trust the devil
stay clear of Lucifer's hand
don't let them wander in the meadow
or you'll wind up in the frying pan
you can put all of my possessions here in Jesus' name
nail a sign on the door
bright and early Sunday morning 
with my walking cane
I'm going up to see my lord

# Take It With Me

Phone's off the hook
No one knows where we are
It's a long time since I
Drank champagne
The ocean is blue
As blue as your eyes
I'm gonna take it with me
When I go
Old long since gone
Now way back when
we lived in Coney Island
Ain't no good thing
ever dies
I'm gonna take it with me
when I go
Far far away a train
whistle blows
Wherever you're goin
Wherever you've been
Waving good bye at the end
of the day
You're up and you're over
and you're far away
Always for you, and
forever yours
It felt just like the old days
we fell asleep
on Beaula's porch
I'm gonna take it with me
when I go
All broken down by
the side of the road
I was never more alive or
Alone
I've worn the faces off
all the cards
I'm gonna take it with me
when I go
Children are playing
at the end of the day
Strangers are singing
on our lawn
It's got to be more
than flesh and bone
All that you've loved
is all you own
In a land there's a town
and in that town there's
A house
and in that house
there's a woman
and in that woman
there's a heart I love
I'm gonna take it
with me when I go
I'm gonna take it
with me when I go.

# Take Me Home

Take me home 
you silly boy
put your arms around me
take me home 
you silly boy
all the world's not round without you
I'm so sorry 
that I broke your heart
please don't leave my side
take me home
you silly boy
cause I'm still in love with you

# Talking At The Same Time

Get a job, save your money, listen to Jane
Everybody knows umbrellas will cost more in the rain
All the news is bad
Is there any other kind?
Everybody’s talking at the same time
Well it’s hard times for some
For others it’s sweet
Someone makes money when there’s blood in the street
Don’t take any lip
Stay in line
Everybody’s talking at the same time
Well the dog is in the kitchen
And the war drags on
The trees wait by the freeway
All the moneys all gone
Well she told me she would leave me
I ignored all the signs
And now everybody’s talking at the same time
Everybody’s talking at the same time
Ain’t no one coming to pull you from the mud
You gotta build your nest high enough to ride out the flood
I know you’re leaving and there’s no more next time
Everybody’s talking at the same time
A tiny boy sat and he played in the sand
He made a sword from a stick
And a gun from his hand
Well we bailed out all the millionaires
They’ve got the fruit
We’ve got the rind
And everybody’s talking at the same time
Everybody’s talking at the same time

# Tango Till They're Sore

Well ya play that Tarantella 
All the hounds they start to roar
And the boys all go to hell 
Then the Cubans hit the floor
And they drive along the pipeline 
They tango till they're sore
They take apart their nightmares 
And they leave them by the door
Let me fall out of the window 
With confetti in my hair
Deal out jacks or better 
On a blanket by the stairs
I'll tell you all my secrets 
But I lie about my past
So send me off to bed forever more
Make sure they play my theme song 
I guess daisies will have to do
Just get me to New Orleans 
And paint shadows on the pews
Turn the spit on that pig 
Kick the drum and let me down
Put my clarinet beneath your bed 
Till I get back in town
Let me fall out of the window 
With confetti in my hair
Deal out jacks or better 
On a blanket by the stairs
I'll tell you all my secrets 
But I lie about my past
So send me off to bed forever more
Just make sure she's all in calico 
And the colour of a doll
Wave the flag on cadillac day 
And a skillet on the wall
Cut me a switch or hold your breath 
Till the sun goes down
Write my name on the hood 
Send me off to another town
Let me fall out of the window 
With confetti in my hair
Deal out jacks or better 
On a blanket by the stairs
I'll tell you all my secrets 
But I lie about my past
So send me off to bed forever more
Send me off to bed forever more
Send me off to bed forever more
Send me off to bed forever more

# Telephone Call From Istanbul

All night long on the broken glass
livin in a medicine chest
mediteromanian hotel back
sprawled across a roll top desk
the monkey rode the blade on an 
overhead fan
they paint the donkey blue if you pay
I got a telephone call from Istanbul
my baby's coming home today
will you sell me one of those if I shave my head
get me out of town, is what fireball said
never trust a man in a blue trench coat
never drive a car when you're dead
Saturday's a festival 
Friday's a gem
dye your hair yellow 
and raise your hem
follow me to beulah's on 
dry creek road
I got to wear the hat that my baby done sewed
take me down to buy a tux on 
red rose bear
got to cut a hole in the day
I got a telephone call from Istanbul
my baby's coming home today

# Tell It To Me

They say you're seeing someone 
you're wearing his ring
they say you laughed 
when you heard my name
they say he takes you dancing 
he holds you so near
they say he'll buy you anything
tell me am I foolish
I don't believe these stories
I'll be coming home soon
Louise Louise 
if it's true
tell it to me
I know you will not see me
but I know you have a daughter
I hear she has my eyes
they say she calls him father
and he's proud of her
even believes all of your lies
but for all your faithless beauty
I'd give all my tomorrows
if you're still thinking of me
Louise Louise 
if it's true
tell it to me

# Temptation

Rusted brandy in a diamond glass
everything is made from dreams
time is made from honey slow and sweet
only the fools know what it means
temptation, temptation, temptation
oh, temptation, temptation, I can't resist.
I know that she is made of smoke
but I've lost my way
she knows that I am broke
so that I must play
temptation, temptation, temptation
oh, whoa, temptation, temptation, I can't resist.
Dutch pink and Italian blue
she is there waiting for you
my will has disappeared
now my confusions oh so clear
temptation, temptation, temptation
whoa, whoa, temptation, temptation
I can't resist.

# That Feel

Well, there's one thing you can't lose
It's that feel
Your pants, your shirt, your shoes
But not that feel
You can throw it out in the rain
You can whip it like a dog
You can chop it down like an old dead tree
You can always see it
When you're coming into town
Once you hang it on the wall
You can never take it down
But there's one thing you can't lose
And it's that feel
You can pawn your watch and chain
But not that feel
It always comes and finds you
It will always hear you cry
I cross my wooden leg
And I swear on my glass eye
It will never leave you high and dry
Never leave you loose
It's harder to get rid of than tattoos
But there's one thing you can't do
Is lose that feel
You can throw it off a bridge
You can lose it in a fire
You can leave it at the altar
But it will make you out a liar
You can fall down in the street
You can leave it in the lurch
Well you say that it's gospel
But I know that it's only church
And there's one thing you can't lose
And it's that feel
It's that feel

# That's The Way

That's the way the stomach rumbles
That's the way the bee bumbles
That's the way the needle pricks
That's the way the glue sticks
That's the way the potato mashes
That's the way the pan flashes
That's the way the market crashes
That's the way the whip lashes
That's the way the teeth knashes
That's the way the gravy stains
That's the way the moon wanes

# This One's from the Heart

I should go out and honk the horn 
it's Independence Day
instead I just pour 
myself a drink
it's got to be love 
I've never felt this way
oh baby 
this one's from the heart
the shadows on the wall 
look like a railroad track
I wonder if he's ever coming back
The moon is a yellow stain 
across the sky
oh baby 
this one's from the heart
maybe I'll go down to the corner 
and get a racing form
but I should probably wait here 
by the phone
and the brakes need adjustment 
on the convertible
oh baby 
this one's from the heart
the worm is climbing 
the avocado tree
rubbing its back against the wall
I pour myself a double sympathy
oh baby 
this one's from the heart
blondes brunettes and redheads 
put the hammer down
To pound a cold chisel 
through my heart.
but they were nothing but apostrophes
oh baby 
this one's from the heart
I can't tell 
is that a siren or a saxophone
but the roads get so slippery when it rains
I love you more than all these words can ever say
oh baby 
this one's from the heart

# Til The Money Runs Out

Check this strange beverage that falls out from the sky
splashin bagdad on the hudson in Panther Martin's eyes
he's high and outside wearin candy apple red
scarlett gave him twenty-seven stitches in his head
with a pint of green chartreuse ain't nothin seems right
you buy the sunday paper on a saturday night
Can't you hear the thunder someone stole my watch
I sold a quart of blood and bought a half a pint of scotch
someone tell those chinamen on Telegraph Canyon Road
when youre on the bill with the spoon there ain't no time to unload
so bye bye baby baby bye bye
droopy stranger lonely dreamer toy puppy and the prado
were laughin as they piled into Olmos eldorado
jesus whispered eeni meany miney moe
they're too proud to duck their heads that's why they bring it down so low
So bye bye baby baby bye bye
the pointed man is smack dab in the middle of July
swingin from the rafters in his brand new tie
he said I can't go back to that hotel room all they do is shout
but I'll stay with you baby till the money runs out
so bye bye baby baby bye bye
so bye bye baby baby bye bye
bye bye bye
by bye baby baby bye bye
bye bye baby baby bye bye
bye bye baby baby bye bye
bye bye baby baby bye bye
bye bye baby baby bye bye
oh bye bye baby
bye bye baby baby bye bye

# Time

Well the smart money's on Harlow 
And the moon is in the street
The shadow boys are breaking all the laws
And you're east of East St. Louis
And the wind is making speeches
And the rain sounds like a round of applause
Napoleon is weeping in the Carnival saloon
His invisible fiance is in the mirror
The band is going home 
It's raining hammers, it's raining nails
Yes, it's true, there's nothin' left for him down here
And it's Time Time Time
And it's Time Time Time
And it's Time Time Time
That you love
And it's Time Time Time
And they all pretend they're Orphans 
And their memory's like a train
You can see it getting smaller as it pulls away
And the things you can't remember 
Tell the things you can't forget that 
History puts a saint in every dream
Well she said she'd stick around 
Until the bandages came off
But these mamas boys just don't know when to quit
And Matilda asks the sailors are those dreams 
Or are those prayers?'
So just close your eyes, son
And this won't hurt a bit
And it's Time Time Time
And it's Time Time Time
And it's Time Time Time
That you love
And it's Time Time Time
Well, things are pretty lousy for a calendar girl
The boys just dive right off the cars 
And splash into the street
And when she's on a roll she pulls a razor 
From her boot and a thousand 
Pigeons fall around her feet
So put a candle in the window
And a kiss upon his lips
Till the dish outside the window fills with rain
Just like a stranger with the weeds in your heart
And pay the fiddler off till I come back again
Oh, it's time, time, time
And it's time, time, time
And it's Time Time Time
And it's Time Time Time
And it's Time Time Time
That you love
And it's Time Time Time

# Tom Tales

Okay, alright, thank you, alright… now we can chat a bit. Okay, um, this is really weird. You know, vultures, I’ve seen a lot of vultures since I’ve entered the Texas border, a lot of vultures. The interesting thing about vultures is that, well, the reason they spend so much time in the air is because they’re so light because they eat so infrequently. So they’re mostly feathers, so a lot of times you’ll see them doing this and you’ll think “Oh, he’s probably going to land soon and eat,” but a lot of times he’s thinking to himself “How the fuck am I gonna get down there?” Now here’s the sad part and imagine if you had to make the same choice yourself. After dining, and frankly most vultures that are injured, this is according to the Bird Rescue… most vultures that are injured were injured while dining. That’s kinda sad… to be hit by a car while you’re eating, but the problem is that once they’ve landed and they’d eaten a lot, they eat so much cause they eat so infrequently, they eat so much that they can’t take off without throwing up. I know, that’s tough… so what a choice, you know, you just had a big meal and you have to lose the whole damn thing just to get back up in the sky again. I think of that all the time when I’m having hard times.

Here’s another interesting thing about them, the gas company has started using them to spot gas leaks in the field, because, well… think about it. They think it’s a dead animal but it’s just a gas leak, you know, so they gather… anyway, I find it interesting anyway. Okay, enough about me. Okay, uh, one last thing… you know during World War II, they made, this is in Germany… they made a soup, like an alphabet soup, only instead of the alphabet it was swastikas and they called it pastika soup and apparently it was very popular in Berlin. I’m sorry about that one too.

Okay, here’s something really interesting, I found interesting anyway. You know, rats don’t eat because they are hungry… they’re just grinding down their teeth, and if you don’t believe that, well… my dad found a rat in a room, a concrete room where there was absolutely nothing to eat, not even a rock… and he’d been in there for two weeks and hadn’t had nothing to eat. What happened with his lower teeth is they’d grown through the roof of his mouth and had come out through the top of his head and his uppers had gone down through his chin and they looked like a little goatee. I know, I know… it’s hard to find people that are as interested in these things as I am.

One last thing. Now, they found out that elephants in India, you know they have to wear a big bell around their necks so people know where they are all the time, and you can imagine how fucking annoying that must be, you know, especially in the middle of the night when you’re hungry. So now, elephants scoop up a big hunk of mud and they stick it in the bell to dampen the clapper and then they go off in the middle of the night and steal bananas. Pretty good.

Okay, well… we were in Oklahoma for a while, boy it’s weird in Oklahoma… well it’s weird everywhere if you think of it like that but in Oklahoma, they’ve got laws, there’s laws down there that are still on the books that they feel compelled to enforce. That’s what bothers me and I’m not traveling with an attorney so it makes it difficult, you know, you can’t wash your car on Sunday using wooled underwear, especially if you are wearing an unusual haircut. I never got the connection there between the haircut and the underwear… the other thing that’s weird is that chewing tobacco is strictly enforced, that took some getting used to. Uh, what else? You can’t photograph a rabbit in the middle of the week for some reason, it’s okay on the weekends, I guess they like it better on the weekends… I don’t get it. The other thing is you can’t eat some place that is also on fire. That really limited our choices. Okay, uh, let’s see… there’s something else, here’s another weird one… you can’t get a fish drunk in Oklahoma. They just had a lot of problems with that, they finally had to put an end to it… and you can’t make a monkey smoke a cigarette, that’s the other thing… I know, I know, I know…

Okay, let’s see. Do you know that shrimp, this is really disturbing though, but shrimp... they never give anything to charity. I’ve never known a shrimp to give anything to charity and it’s always bothered me and finally someone told me that basically they’re shellfish and it’s gonna happen… okay, I knew I went too far with that. Thank you for putting a stop to it. Okay, does anybody out there have a parrot? Do you own a parrot is the question. Does anybody in the whole audience own a parrot? Okay, well then you can understand why I went on E-Bay and bought a year’s supplies of parrot diapers. Man, I’m telling you… parrots, I like the conversations; I like the fellowship, but damn… get a grip. Here’s a theory that I have and I’ll run it by you because you’re here… my theory is that if everybody in China, on the very same day, at the very same time, on the very same day, got up on a ladder and jumped as high as they could and came down on the ground, you know, that it would throw the whole Earth off its axis. I haven’t been able to get anybody to go with me with that, like the United Nations or anything… uh, anyway, we should be ready on our side. We’ll pick a day, buy a ladder, get ready… uh, just to keep things… okay.

Okay, what else? Oh, the graveyard shift. Now, when I was a kid I always worked jobs at night and I always had graveyard shifts and everybody kind of threw that expression around very loosely and I wondered what the hell is a graveyard shift is anyway? Other than the fact that you’re working at night, okay I know that much, but what’s the origin of the expression graveyard shift? And then I worked for a while in a graveyard and my boss, Joe Corvello, he explained it to me. What happened in the old days, way, way, way back, hundreds of years ago, people were very nervous about being buried alive, not anymore nervous than we are today it’s just that the technology was not really with it, you could be taking a nap and they’d fucking bury you. So, there was a law that everybody who got buried had to have a string tied around their wrist in the coffin and then they’d run it up through the roof of the coffin and then they’d go up through the dirt and then they’d go over the branch of a tree on which they’d put a bell… and then there’s a guy who sits in the graveyard all night long waiting to hear a bell… that’s the graveyard shift. You’ll like this one too… the bell and the whole apparatus and everything, you know if you find the guy who actually is alive and underground, he’s called a dead ringer. I’m not kidding.

You know, about a year ago… this is really weird and I don’t tell everybody this… during the summer I ingested some pond water, you know, and it’s the weirdest thing… a couple of days later I started to feel something moving in there. I thought, am I pregnant? I don’t know… Anyway, several months went by and I finally had to go to the doctor and they put an ultrasound on me and they found three toads in my stomach… oh boy. But you know they’re off to themselves, they’re off to one side, and you know… why put them on such a bummer… it’s only a drag when we’re watching television and they get really loud and other than that, you know, I’m fine with it, it’s just a thing.

Okay, who has the largest brain in proportion to its body? No, no, no… the ant, swear to god. Who has the largest penis in proportion to its body? No, no, no, no… the barnacle, thank you. Okay, we’ll get on to some actual songs in a minute here… there are more insects in one square mile of Earth then there are people on the entire Earth, think about that, more insects in one square mile than there are people! Imagine if they got to vote or drivers licenses or anything… now, um, you know what the moon smells like? (People yell: “cheese!”) Wrong again, you’ll love this… fireworks. That’s what Neil Armstrong told me, “It smells just like fireworks, man.” And it makes perfect sense, doesn’t it? That’s where we’ve been shooting them for all these years. He says it’s just crazy up there with the fireworks… Do you know how many omelets you can get out of an ostrich egg? Fourteen… that’s a lot of omelets. I’ve gotten along with most of the ostriches I met and um okay… let’s see…

Here’s one… you know the word “bamboozled”… didn’t you ever wonder what the hell they mean when they say “bamboozled”… well way, way, way back, thousands of years ago in China when you got busted for something, they take a piece of bamboo and they’d whack you. You know if you took like fourteen candy bars, you get fourteen whacks. You see the connection though? Bamboozled, bamboo, bamboo, bamboozled… okay, that’s all. One last thing about Sara Bernhardt, the famous American actress… hey, she was a babe, man… she was a total babe. She had her own train car, she slept in a coffin and when she was seventy, she was playing Juliet, babe. Think about that, Juliet… at seventy… and she lost a leg and when she lost her leg, Barnum and Bailey bought her leg, of course… and put it in formaldehyde and charged like, six, eight bucks to come see it. And that was depressing for her, of course… cause she was working across the street, you know, the full her… and to know that your leg is over there making more money than you was so depressing for her… but that’s the business, that’s the business that we’re in. One day, Moe Green got a bullet in the eye but this is the business that we’re in. (Man yells: “Hey Tom, I want to have your baby.” Oh Jesus… well you know, nowadays, I think it’s possible. See my manager, Stuart Ross, but I gotta tell you, my sperm is very expensive now. I’m like a fucking race horse, baby.

Have you’ve wondered why you can never swat a fly? How do they know we’re coming? They don’t know what a swatter is. Do they say “Yeah, swatter coming, swatter coming…”They have no idea what a swatter is. I’ll tell you what happens… they take off backwards. It’s that simple… they’ve taken off backwards their entire lives… okay, that’s all. (Audience members yelling) Uh, my health? My health is fine… you know what, write it down and pass it forward and I’ll take a look at it.

Anyway, Neil Armstrong was the first man on the moon who actually walked on the moon and the guy right behind him on the ladder going down to get to the surface of the moon, now that was Buzz Aldrin… he said “Neil, you are the first man to walk on the moon… I am the very first man to wet his pants on the moon.” He said that, really, he did. He said it to me personally. I know Neil and I know Buzz, so there… and you don’t… okay. But then again, Science Magazine said that the compression of actual moon rocks, the closest thing that they can find on Earth that is closest to the compression of the rocks from the moon is provolone cheese or Vermont cheddar… I’m not shitting you, I wouldn’t shit you… and pig fetuses, you know, they are injecting pig fetuses now with human hormones because they want to use their organs to transplant them into humans so they want to give them some kind of humanistic juice in there so that when the transfer happens, it’ll be a little more commensurate with the… it’s crazy. But now pigs, the fetuses are being born with strangely human faces… one looked just like my Uncle Phil, exactly like my Uncle Phil, even Phil said it looked like him. Ok, I know, I know… we’ll get on, we’ll get on, we’ll get on… What was that for? Because we’re getting on, right? Oh, I see… you’re trying to push me into a song… I know that trick. You know the problem here? The problem here is you guys have never worked together before and you have no actual elected officials so it’s kind of like the early days of America, you know, and everybody’s kind of yelling shit out and somebody’s going “Shut up, shut up…” What? See… you have no President; this is what we call Marshall law.

Ah, okay, do you want another little story or a song? What do you want? That sounded like a cross between a story and a song… you see you can’t get all in line… get in line, babe. Okay, alright, it’s up to me, that’s it… I’m gonna have to take over… Oh, oh, way down in Oklahoma we went to the Spam museum, that was really amazing. They’ve got stuff carved out of Spam, they have portraits of people carved out of Spam… never seen anything like it, but as a Spam fan, I took some of that home with me and I got some of that in my living room and all like little portraits, you know, and “Whoa, whoa… what is that Tom, what is that?” and I said: “Whoa, it’s Spam, it’s Spam”. The thing is it never really deteriorates, the smell is not like it’s decomposing… it’s impossible for it to decompose… and that’s what you’re smelling is really the freshness of it, the eternal freshness of it… it’s kind of embalmed meat is what it really is… what? Oh, oh, oh…I read today that one out of every ten men is important. One out of every ten… and then I realized I read it wrong, I went back and it said “One out of every ten men is impotent”. I don’t know how I changed… I left the R out… so which are you, are you important or are you impotent? I guess that’s all there is to choose from.

I don’t know about you but I spent my entire day at the lost baggage center, you know, have you ever been over there? Fascinating… how they advertise it… things from all over the world… at incredible prices. Its lost baggage is basically what it is… if you ever have lost a bag, your bag is there being sold to somebody else… and it’s right here in Birmingham, I swear to God. So, here’s the ironic thing… I flew in to go to the last baggage center early so that I could shop for basically underwear and socks and they lost my bag. Isn’t that crazy? Okay… here’s one that maybe you’ll like… spiders, spiders, our little eight legged friends, the spider… when the male spider is done building his web, you know those elaborately beautiful webs that they build at night while you’re sleeping and you wake up in the morning and it’s glistening and beautiful like that… when he’s done building the web, he reaches out one of his legs… we assume it’s a leg that he’s reaching out, not certain but we assume it’s a leg… and he strums the web and the sound that that makes… that’s not the actual sound, how could I know the actual sound? But it’s not bad, is it? I mean, if you were a female spider, you’d be like… anyway, what happens is that the sound that the web makes is irresistible to the female spider and she comes… some of them come in from different states when they hear that and they get in line for the big guy. Anyway, it’s just kind of a kooky thing that happens in the world.

In Oklahoma, you can get in trouble for kissing a stranger. Think about that, I mean you can go to jail for kissing a stranger. I mean, we’re all strangers at a certain point, how could the world continue if somebody didn’t kiss a stranger, right? But, uh, I travel with an attorney so… here’s another thing; you know that a mink and an ermine are the same thing? And you know that a mink and an ermine are all members of the weasel family? And if you see a beautiful woman wearing a mink, you can walk right up to her and say “I love your weasel.” And she can’t slap you… I mean, theoretically she can’t slap you. I would do it with an attorney present at all times… so every time in the world there’s a male ejaculation, I know that’s a tough word so from now on we’re just gonna say “it”… whenever “it” happens, it releases two hundred and fifty million sperm… now only one of those sperm obviously can actually fertilize the egg… so if you’re here, you’re already a winner. You know what I mean? That’s the way I see it.

Okay, here’s a little story for everybody now… you know what really gets me? I was in a community, let’s just say it was a bad neighborhood and I used to refer to it and I’d say 9th and Hennepin, boy, 9th and Hennepin… here’s what bothers me, they really cleaned the place up and every time I said 9th and Hennepin, people looked at me like I was doing card tricks for a dog… and some guy would say “You know my wife, she got some sandals down there… they have a little frozen yogurt place”. And I went: “You could get killed for sandals down there!”
Anyway… okay, you know I’ve always been a word guy, I like weird words and I like American slang and all that and words that are no longer being used… I like to drag them out of the box and wave them around… this is an interesting one, it’s amazing how in addition to punctuation just a little pause in the wrong place can just completely transform the meaning of something. I’ll give you a really good example… you know, you’re at the ball game and you got your hot dog and you look around and say “Where are all the condiments?” and they point over there and you go “Oh, okay there’s the condiments.” I’m so glad that they said it like that because when I said it I heard “Where are the condom mints?” That’s just me and I have to live with me. I didn’t say it back to her or she would have slapped me but then I thought that’s not a bad idea… someone could get a hold of something like that and come up with a whole new product… I just offer it to you tonight and we’ll just wait and see what happens.

I made one really ridiculous purchase… you know this is really weird… somebody took a picture of me and they got a picture of my watch, you know, and they said “Well he was wearing a really ratty suit but I think he had about $300,000 watch on. I really got a kick out of that… $9.99 at CVS, but hey, if it looks like $300,000, it is! I’m in show business. (Audience member yells: play everything!) Everything? Play everything? I don’t have that much time. I was out there earlier and I sat in some of those chairs you’re sitting in now… pretty damn comfortable, maybe a little too comfortable. You have your own TV? You mean in the chair? You see some of the seats are better than others… she has a VCR and an I-Pod thing you can hook into. Does your chair vibrate? That’s the vibrating chair. I heard it’s against the law to have an unusual haircut here… and you can’t buy booze without a note from your wife. That’s really weird… I travel with an attorney, of course…

Here’s another thing… a little food thing. You know how every time you get a piece of fish they give you a little piece of lemon with it and everybody thinks that it’s because the flavor is so much better with lemon on it… untrue. The idea was when people ate fish originally, they were so afraid of ingesting bones and having the bone caught in their throat and dying, somebody told them if you put a little lemon in your mouth after you have a bite of fish, it will kill the bone, it’ll dissolve the bone, it’ll just disintegrate the bone, which of course is total bullshit but that’s what happened and now we’ve got lemon and fish and all that… I had a math teacher when I was a kid whose name was Mr. Falby and he had a piece of fish during a test we were having and he choked on a fish bone and he died in the middle of our math test… it was kind of an answer to a prayer that I made earlier. It wasn’t that specific… I didn’t mention anything about the fish or the bone or even on that day… but we have a connection I guess.

I’m sorry, what? You’re still working at the airport? I’m happy for you. I’ll see you on our way out. Here’s a deal… pardon me? Piano is just on beer and wine now. You know what really bothers me is when somebody tells you that their cell phone is also a camera. I just hate that. What’s wrong with having something that’s just what it is and being happy about it? It makes me want to say to them… “My sunglasses are also a tricycle.” But I don’t… okay, we’ve been traveling for about two months now so the laws change from community to community. It’s just bizarre the kind of laws that are still on the books… that’s one of the laws here in Edinbourough that you can no longer order eggs and sausage and it’s sad but it’s just the way it happened with that new mayor. What do we have, what do we have, what do we have? Oh we were gonna try and do this one, we’ll see, this is um…

# Tom Traubert's Blues

Wasted and wounded, it ain't what the moon did
I got what I paid for now
See ya tomorrow, hey Frank can I borrow
a couple of bucks from you, to go 
Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda, you'll go waltzing 
Matilda with me
I'm an innocent victim of a blinded alley
and I'm tired of all these soldiers here
no one speaks English, and everything's broken
and my Stacys are soaking wet
to go waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda, you'll go waltzing
Matilda with me
now the dogs are barking 
and the taxi cabs parking
a lot they can do for me
I begged you to stab me 
you tore my shirt open
and I'm down on my knees tonight
Old Bushmills I staggered, 
you buried the dagger in 
your silhouette window light to go 
waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda, you'll go waltzing 
Matilda with me
now I've lost my St. Christopher 
now that I've kissed her and the 
one-armed bandit knows, and the 
maverick Chinaman, and the cold-blooded signs
and the girls down by the strip tease shows go
waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda, you'll go waltzing 
Matilda with me
no I don't want your sympathy 
the fugitives say that the streets aren't for dreaming now
manslaughter dragnets and the ghosts that sell memories
They want a piece of the action anyhow go 
waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda, you'll go waltzing 
Matilda with me
and you can ask any sailor 
and the keys from the jailer
and the old men in wheelchairs know
that Matilda's the defendant, she killed about a hundred
and she follows wherever you may go
waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda, you'll go waltzing 
Matilda with me
and it's a battered old suitcase 
to a hotel someplace
and a wound that will never heal
no prima donna, the perfume is on
an old shirt that is stained with blood and whiskey
and goodnight to the street sweepers 
the night watchman flame keepers
and goodnight Matilda, too

# Top Of The Hill

New corn yellow and slaughterhouse red
The birds keep singing
Baby after your dead
I'm gonna miss you plenty
Big old world
With our abalone earrings
And your mother of pearl
Stop and get me on the ride up
Stop and get me on the ride up
Stop and get me on the ride up
I'm only goin
I'm, only goin
I'm only goin to the top
Of the hill
I need your moon to be the sky
Sky against
Don't get your trouser button
Stuck on the fence
Diego red and bedlam money are fine
Why don't you come up here
And see me sometime
Stop and get me on the ride up
Stop and get me on the ride up
Stop and get me on the ride up
I'm only goin
I'm, only goin
I'm only goin to the top
Of the hill
There's very little leeway
I seen a mattress on the freeway
The moon rises over Dog Street
Jefferson said every things reet
Have all the lights burned
Out on heaven again
I'll never roll the number 7 again
I'm made of bread and I'm on an
Ocean of wine
I hear all the birdies
On the phone just fine
Stop and get me on the ride up
Stop and get me on the ride up
Stop and get me on the ride up
I'm only goin
I'm, only goin
I'm only goin to the top
Of the hill
Black joke and the bean soup
Big sky and the Ford Coupe
Old maid and the dry bones
Red Rover and the Skinny Bones Jones
47 mules to pull this train
We're getting married
In the pouring rain
You need your differential and
Plenty of oil
You load the wagon till
The end of the world
Stop and get me on the ride up
Stop and get me on the ride up
Stop and get me on the ride up
I'm only goin
I'm only goin
I'm only goin to the top
Of the hill
What's your throttle made of
Is it money or bone
Don't doddle or you'll
Never get home
Opium, fireworks, vodka and meat
Scoot over and save me a seat
Stop and get me on the ride up
Stop and get me on the ride up
Stop and get me on the ride up
I'm only goin
I'm, only goin
I'm only goin to the top
Of the hill
If I had it all to do all 
Over again
I'd try to rise above the law of man
Why don' cha gimme nother
Sip of your cup
Turn a Rolls Royce into a
Chicken coup, uh huh
Stop and get me on the ride up
Stop and get me on the ride up
Stop and get me on the ride up
I'm only goin
I'm, only goin
I'm only goin to the top
Of the hill

# Town With No Cheer

Well, it's hotter 'n blazes and all the long faces
there'll be no oasis for a dry local grazier
there'll be no refreshment for a thirsty jackaroo
from Melbourne to Adelaide on the overlander
with newfangled buffet cars and faster locomotives
the train stopped in Serviceton less and less often
There's nothing sadder than a town with no cheer
Vic Rail decided the canteen was no longer 
necessary there
no spirits, no bilgewater and 80 dry locals
and the high noon sun beats a hundred and four
there's a hummingbird trapped in a closed down shoe store
This tiny Victorian rhubarb kept the watering hole open for sixty five years
now it's boilin' in a miserable March 21st
wrapped the hills in a blanket of Patterson's curse
the train smokes down the xylophone 
there'll be no stoppin' here
all ya can be is thirsty in a town with no cheer
no Bourbon, no Branchwater
though the townspeople here 
fought her Vic Rail decree tooth and nail
now it's boilin' in a miserable March 21st
wrapped the hills in a blanket of Patterson's curse
the train smokes down the xylophone 
there'll be no stopping here
all ya can be is thirsty in a town with no cheer

# Train Song

Well I broke down in E. St. Louis 
On the Kansas City line
and I drunk up all of my money 
that I borrowed every time
and I fell down at the derby
and now the night's black as a crow
It was a train that took me away from here 
but a train can't bring me home
What made my dreams so hollow 
was standing at the depot
with a steeple full of swallows 
that could never ring the bell
and I come ten thousand miles away 
with not one thing to show
well it was a train that took me away from here 
but a train can't take me home
I remember when I left
without bothering to pack
you know I up and left, with 
just the clothes I had on my back
now I'm so sorry for what I've done 
and I'm out here on my own
well it was a train that took me away from 
here but a train can't bring me home

# Trampled Rose

Long way going to 
Get my medicine
Sky's the autumn grey of
A lonely wren
Piano from a window played
Gone tomorrow, gone
Yesterday
I found it in the street
At first I did not see
Lying at my feet a
Trampled rose
Passing the hat in church
It never stops going round
You never pay just once
To get the job done
What I done to me, I done
To you, 
What happened to
The trampled rose?
In the muddy street, with
The fireworks and leaves
A blind man with a cup I asked
Would he play "Kisses Sweeter
Than Wine"
I know that rose like I
Know my name, the
One I gave my love
It was the same, now
I find it in the street
A trampled rose

# Trouble's Braids

Well I pulled on trouble's braids
and I hid in the briars 
out by the quick mud
stayin' away from the main roads
passin' out wolf tickets 
downwind from the blood hounds
and I pulled on trouble's braids
and I lay by a cypress 
as quiet as a stone
'til the bleeding stopped
I blew the weather vane 
off some old road house
I built a fire in the 
skeleton back seat of an old Tucker
and I pulled on trouble's braids
I spanked cold red mud 
where the hornet stung deep
and I tossed in the ditch 
in a restless sleep
and I pulled on trouble's braids
I hung my rain-soaked jacket 
on some old barbed wire
poured cold rusty water 
on a miserable fire
I pulled on trouble's braids
the creek was swollen by daybreakand I could just 
barely see
and I floated downstream 
on an old dead tree
and I pulled on trouble's braids
I pulled on trouble's braids
I pulled on trouble's braids
I pulled on trouble's braids

# Underground

Rattle big black bones in the Danger zone
There's a rumblin' groan down below
There's a big dark town, it's a place I've found
There's a world going on underground
They're alive, they're awake
While the rest of the world is asleep
Below the mine shaft roads, it will all unfold
There's a world going on underground
All the roots hang down, swing from town to town
They are marching around down under your boots
All the trucks unload beyond the gopher holes
There's a world going on underground

# Union Square

Well time is always money for the boys at Union Square
You can bust your ass till doomsday but don't forget to say your prayers
Someone's got a wad on the backstreet Sacc got a bran' new slack
And your baby is handcuffed on the front seat
Sit right there, boy and you relax
I'm goin' down down down
I'm goin' down down down
I'm goin' down down down
I'm goin' down down down
Well they spill out of the Cinema 14 to that drag bar down the block
Best live show by far on the whole east coast with a bank rolled up in your sock
She stand right there for your pleasure
Half Puerto Rican Chinese
You got to find your baby somebody to measure
I'm goin' to get me some of these baby
I'm goin' down down down
I'm goin' down down down
I'm goin' down down down
I'm goin' down down down
Four in the mornin on a Sunday
Sacco drinkin' whiskey in church
Half pint festival brandy
That boy 'bout to fall right off his perch
The guy in the sweaters off duty
Out in front on the welfare hotel
The guy in the dress is a beauty
Go all the wayand I swear you never can tell
I'm goin' down down down
I'm goin' down down down
I'm goin' down down down
I'm goin' down down down

# Virginia Avenue

Well, I'm walking on down Virginia Avenue
Trying to find somebody to tell my troubles to
Harold's Club is closing, and everybody's going on home
What's a poor boy to do?
I'll just get on back into my short, make it back to the fort
Sleep off all the craziness that's inside of my brain
There's gotta be some place that's better than this
This life I'm leading is driving me insane
And let me tell you I'm dreaming
Let me tell you that I'm dreaming to the twilight
This town has got me down
I've seen all of the highlights, I've been walking all around
I won't make a fuss, I'll take a Greyhound bus
To carry me away from here now
Tell me, what have I got to lose?
Cause I'm walking on down Columbus Avenue
The bars are all closing, cause it's quarter to two
Every town I go to is like a lock without a key
The blues I leave behind keep catching up on me
Let me tell you they're catching up on me
They're catching up on me
Catching up on me
Catching up on me
Catching up on me

# Walk Away

Dot King was whittled from the bone of Cain
with a little drop of poison in a red red blood
she needs a way to turn around the bend
she said I wanna walk away and start all over again
there are things I've done I can't erase
I wanna look in the mirror and see another face
I said never but I'm doin' it again
I wanna walk away and start over again
no more rain no more roses
on my way
slake my thirst in a cool cool pond
there's a widower in every place
there's a heart that's beatin' in every page
the beginning of it starts at the end
well it's time to walk away and start over again
weather's murder at a hundred and three
William Ray shot Cora Belle Lee
a yellow dog knows when he has sinned
you wanna walk away and start over again
no more rain no more roses
on my way slake my thirst in a cool cool pond
Cooper told Molly the whole block's gone
they're dyin' for jewelry money and clothes
I always get out of the trouble I'm in
I wanna walk away and start over again
I left my bible by the side of the road
carved my initials in an old dead tree
I'm goin' away but I'm gonna be back when
it's time to walk away and start all over again
oh oh yeah
yeah
it's time to walk away
you gotta walk away
gotta walk away
just wanna walk away yeah
I wanna walk away and start over again
I wanna walk away
wanna walk away

# Walking Spanish

He's got himself a homemade special
You know his glass is full of sand
And it feels just like a jaybird the way it fits into his hand
He rolled a blade up in his trick towel 
They slap their hands against the wall
You never trip, you never stumble
He's walking spanish down the hall
Slip him a picture of our Jesus or give him a spoon to dig a hole
What all he done ain't no one's business but he'll need blankets for the cold
They dim the lights over on Broadway
Even the king has bowed his head
Every face looks right up at Mason
He's walking spanish down the hall
Latella's screeching for a blind pig 
Punk Sander's carved it out of wood
He never sang when he got hoodwinked 
They tried it all but he never would
Tomorrow morning there'll be laundry 
But he'll be somewhere else to hear the call
Don't say good bye he's just leavin' early
He's walking spanish down the hall
All St. Bartholomew said was whispered 
Into the ear of Blind Jack Dawes
All the Baker told the machine 
Was that he never broke the law
Go on and tip your hat up to the Pilate
Take off your watch, your rings and all
Even Jesus wanted just a little more time
When he was walking spanish down the hall

# Warm Beer And Cold Women

It's warm beer and cold women, no I just don't fit in
Every joint I stumbled into tonight, that's just how its been
All these double-knit strangers with gin and vermouth
And recycled stories, in the naugahyde booths
And the platinum blondes and tobacco brunettes
I'll just be drinking to forget you, I light another cigarette
And the band's playing something by Tammy Wynette
And the drinks are on me tonight
All my conversations now, I'll just be talking about you, baby
I'm boring some sailor as I try to get through
I just want him to listen now I say that's all you have to do
He said I'm better off without you, until I showed him my tattoo
And now the moon's rising, ain't no time to lose
Time to get down to drinking, tell the band to play the blues
And the drinks are on me I'll buy another round
At the last ditch attempt saloon
Warm beer and cold women, no I just don't fit in
Every joint I stumble into tonight, that's just how it's been
All these double-knit strangers with gin and vermouth
Receding hairlines, in the naugahyde booths
And the platinum blondes and tobacco brunettes
I'll just be drinking to forget you, baby, I light a menthol cigarette
And the band's playing something by Johnnie Barnette
At the last ditch attempt saloon

# Watch Her Disappear

Last night I dreamed that I was dreaming of you
and from a window across the lawn I watched you undress
wearing a sunset of purple tightly woven around your hair
that rose in strangled ebony curls
moving in a yellow Bedroom light
The air is wet with sound
The faraway yelping of a wounded dog
and the ground is drinking a slow faucet leak
Your house is so soft and fading
as it soaks the black summer heat
a light goes on and a door opens
and yellow cat runs out on the stream of hall light
and into the yard
a wooden cherry scent is faintly breathing the air
I hear your champagne laugh
you wear two lavender orchids
one in your hair and one on your hip
a string of yellow carnival lights
comes on with the dusk
circling the lake in a slowly dipping halo
and I hear a Banjo tango
and you dance into the shadow of a Black Poplar Tree
I watch you as you disappear
I watch you as you disappear
I watch you as you disappear...

# Way Down In The Hole

When you walk through the garden you gotta watch your back
well I beg your pardon walk the straight and narrow track
if you walk with Jesus he's gonna save your soul
you gotta keep the devil way down in the hole
he's got the fire and the fury at his command
well you don't have to worry if you hold on to Jesus' hand
we'll all be safe from Satan when the thunder rolls
just gotta help me keep the devil way down in the hole
all the angels sing bout Jesus' mighty sword
and they'll shield you with their wings and keep you close to the lord
don't pay heed to temptation for his hands are so cold
you gotta help me keep the devil way down in the hole...

# We're All Mad Here

Hang me in a bottle like a cat
Let the crows pick me clean but for my hat
Where the wailing of a baby meets the footsteps of the dead
We're all mad here
As the Devil sticks his flag into the mud
Mrs. Carroll has run off with Reverend Judd
Hell is such a lonely place
And your big expensive face will never last
And you'll die with the rose still on your lips
And in the time the heart-shaped bone that was your hips
And all the worms they will climb the rugged ladder of your spine
We're all mad here
And my eyeballs roll this terrible terrain
We're all inside a decomposing train
And your eyes will die like fish
And the shore of your face will turn to bone

# What Keeps Mankind Alive

You gentlemen who think you have a mission
to purge us of the seven deadly sins
should first sort out the basic food position
then start your preaching that's where it begins
you lot who preach restraint and watch your waist as well
should learn for once the way the world is run
however much you twist or whatever lies that you tell
food is the first thing morals follow on
so first make sure that those who are now starving
get proper helpings when we all start carving
what keeps mankind alive
what keeps mankind alive 
the fact that millions
are daily tortured stifled punished silenced and oppressed
mankind can keep alive thanks to its brilliance
in keeping its humanity repressed
for once you must try not to shirk the facts
mankind is kept alive
by bestial acts

# What's He Building?

What's he building in there?
What the hell is he building in there?
He has subscriptions to those magazines 
He never waves when he goes by
He's hiding something from the rest of us 
He's all to himself 
I think I know why he took down the tire swing from the Peppertree
He has no children of his own you see 
He has no dog and he has no friends and his lawn is dying and what about all those packages he sends. 
What's he building in there?
with that hook light on the stairs. 
What's he building in there 
I'll tell you one thing
he's not building a playhouse for the children 
what's he building in there?
Now what's that sound from under the door? 
He's pounding nails into a hardwood floor and I swear to god I heard someonemoaning low and I keep seeing the blue light of a T.V. show
He has a router and a table saw and you won't believe what Mr. Sticha saw
There's poison underneath the sink of course but there's also enough formaldehyde to choke a horse 
What's he building in there. 
What the hell is he building in there? 
I heard he has an ex-wife in some place called Mayors Income, Tennessee
and he used to have a consulting business in Indonesia but what is he building in there?
What the hell is he building in there?
He has no friends but he gets a lot of mail
I'll bet he spent a little time in jail
I heard he was up on the roof last night signaling with a flashlight
and what's that tune he's always whistling
What's he building in there?
What's he building in there?
We have a right to know

# Whistle Down The Wind

I've grow up here now all of my life
But I dreamed someday I'd go where blue eyed girls and red guitars and naked rivers flow
I'm not all I thought I'd be I always stayed around
I've been as far as Mercy and Grand Frozen to the ground
I can't stay here and I'm scared to leave
(Just kiss me once and then) 
I'll go to hell I might as well 
Be whistlin' down the wind
The bus at the corner
The clock's on the wall
Broken windmill
There's no wind at all
I've yelled and I've cursed
If I stay here I'll rust
I'm stuck like a shipwreck out here in the dust
Sky is red and the world's on fire
And the corn is taller than me
The dog is tied to a wagon of rain
And the road is as wet as the sea
And sometimes the music from a dance will carry across the plains
And the places that I'm dreaming of
Do they dream only of me?
There are places where they never sleep and the circus never ends
So I will take the Marley Bone Coach and Whistle down the wind

# Whistlin' Past The Graveyard

I come in on a night train with an arm full of boxcars
on the wings of a magpie cross a hooligan night
and I busted up a chifferobe way out by the kokomo
cooked up a mess of mulligan and got into a fight
whistlin' past the graveyard steppin' on a crack
me and mother hubbard papa one-eyed Jack
you probably seen me sleepin out by the railroad tracks
go on and ask the prince of darkness
what about all that smoke come from the stack
sometimes I kill myself a jackal suck out all the blood
steal myself a station wagon drivin' through the mud
I'm gonna be whistlin' past the graveyard steppin' on a crack
me and mother hubbard papa one-eyed Jack
I know you seen my headlights and the honkin of my horn
I'm callin out my bloodhounds chase the devil through the corn
last night I chugged the Mississippi now that suckers dry as a bone
I was born in a taxi cab I'm never goin home
Whistlin' past the graveyard steppin' on a crack
me and mother hubbard Papa one-eyed Jack
my eyes have seen the glory of the draining of the ditch
I only come to Baton Rouge I gotta find myself a witch
I'm gonna snatch me up a couple of em every time it rains
you'll see a locomotive probably thinkin its a train
whistlin' past the graveyard steppin' on a crack
me and mother hubbard Papa one-eyed Jack
what you think is the sunshine is just a twinkle in my eye
that ring around my fingers called the fourth of July
when I get a little bit lonesome and a tear falls from my cheek
there's gonna be an ocean in the middle of the week
whistlin' past the graveyard steppin' on a crack
me and mother hubbard Papa one-eyed Jack
I come into town on a night train with an arm full of boxcars
on the wings of a magpie cross a hooligan night
I'm gonna tear me off a rainbow and wear it for a tie
I never told the truth so I can never tell a lie
whistlin' past the graveyard steppin' on a crack
me and mother hubbard Papa one-eyed Jack

# Who Are You

They're lining up to mad dog your tilta whirl
3 shots for a dollar
Win a real live doll
All the lies that you tell
I believed them so well, Take them back,
Take them back to your red house
For that fearful leap into the dark
I did my time In the jail of your arms
Now Ophelia wants to know 
Where she should turn
Tell me... What did you do, 
What did you do the last time?
Why don't you do that
Go on ahead and take this the wrong way
Time's not your friend
Do you cry, Fo you pray
Do you wish them away
Do you still leave nothing 
But bones in the way?
Did you bury the carnival
Lions and all
Excuse me while I sharpen my nails
And just who are you this time?
You look rather tired
(Who drinks from your shoe)
Are you pretending to love
Well, I hear that it pays well
How do your pistol and your Bible and 
Your sleeping pills go.
Are you still jumping out of windows in expensive clothes?
Well I fell in love 
With your sailor's mouth and your wounded eyes.
You better get down on the floor
Don't you know this is war
Tell me who are you this time?
Tell me who are you this time?

# Widow's Grove

I met you in the saddle rode you in the dust
held your hand to the heavens 
pulled your heart to the earth
there was something that blinded me more than the mist
the breath of the cottonwood buds lighter yet
you rode the maypole of dance hall legs galloped to another's embrace
I bit the flowers from your wrist corsage
you waltzed too slowly too slowly you waltzed with that girl from Widow's Grove
oh I'd follow you to the river that washes out to the sea
through the wind through the rain of a cold dark night
that's where I'll be
near the breath of a swallow petals dropped as you fell
you grabbed me then shyly held me against the stone cold well
in your hand was a glass 
you held the ice against the night
it dripped and it sparkled 
I laughed a wish
before it all slipped down the dark tunneled well
I heard it melt quietly 
I looked at you bent to the earth with just one pleading wish
your skirts brushed to the furious pounding
I'd follow you to the river that washes out to the sea
through the wind through the rain of a cold dark night
that's where I'll be
I hid in the elm and raised the bough 
that hung even with your neck
I chased you and drowned you there deep in the well
when your mouth was full and wet 
I swallowed all your reckless fate
with your last breath
you moaned too drunk to wake
I'd follow you to the river 
that washes out to the sea
through the wind through 
the rain of a cold dark night
that's where I'll be

# Woe

The ribbon round your neck
against your skin that's pale as bone
It is my favorite thing you've worn
The band is playing our song
And we won't go home, 'til morn

# World Keeps Turning

On our anniversary
There'll be someone else where you used to be
the world don't care and yet it clings to me
the moon is gold and silvery
who knows where the sidewalk ends
well the road will turn and the road will bend
they always say he marks the sparrow's fall
how can anyone believe it all
well the band has stopped playing but we keep dancing
the world keeps turning the world keeps turning
on his hand he wore the ring of another
the world keeps turning the world keeps turning
we broke the bank and we tore up the place
we disappeared oh without a trace
now the sun it falls into the sea
I know I'm the only one for me
I was so green and the dress you wore was yellow
the world keeps turning the world keeps turning
the sun is down and the moon is in the meadow
the world keeps turning the world keeps turning
put a hat on your head
will you paint the whole damn town red with me
well the band has stopped playing but we keep dancing
the world keeps turning the world keeps turning
on his hand he wore the ring of another
the world keeps turning the world keeps turning

# Wrong Side Of The Road

Put a dead cat on the railroad tracks
when the wolfbanes blooming by the tressel
and get the eyeball of a rooster
and the stones from a ditch
and wash em down with bilge water
and say you'll never snitch
take the buttons from a yellow jacket
the feather from a buzzard
the blood from a bounty hunter's cold black heart
catch the tears of a widow in a thimble made of glass
tell your mama and papa they can kiss your ass
poison all the water in the wishin well
and hang all them scarecrows from a Sycamore tree
burn down all them honeymoons put em in a pillow case
wait next to the switch blades at the amusement park for me
strangle all the Christmas carols scratch out all the prayers
tie em up with barbed wire and push em down the stairs
and I'll whittle you a pistol for keep the nightmares of the blinds
them sunabitches always seem to sneak up from behind
siphon all the gas from your daddy's pickup truck
fill up Johnny's t-bird I got a couple of bucks
put on a little perfume and wear ribbon in your hair
careful that you don't wake up the hounds
tear a bolt of lightning of the side of the sky
throw it in the cedar chest if you want to tell me why
bring me the gear shift knob from a 49 Merc
lay down here beside me let me hold you in the dirt
and you're gonna tremble
tear the throat out of the night
sink your teeth into my shoulder
dig your nails into my back
tell that little girl to let go of my sleeve
you'll be a woman when I catch you come baby fall in love with me
then with my double barrel shotgun and a whole box of shells
we'll celebrate the fourth of july
we'll do 100 mph spendin' someone else's dough
we'll drive all the way to Reno
on the wrong side of the road
the wrong side of the road
on the wrong side of the road
the wrong side of the road
wrong side of the road
wrong side of the road
hey baby

# Yesterday Is Here

If you want money in your pocket and a top hat on your head
a hot meal on your table and a blanket on your bed
well today is grey skies tomorrow is tears
you'll have to wait till yesterday is here
Well I'm going to New York City and I'm leaving on a train and if you want to stay behind and wait til I come back again
well today is grey skies tomorrow is tears
you'll have to wait til yesterday is here
If you want to go where the rainbows end
you'll have to say goodbye all our dreams come true baby up ahead
and it's out where your memories lie
well the road's out before me and the moon is shining bright
what I want you to remember as I disappear tonight
today is grey skies tomorrow's tears
you'll have to wait til yesterday is here

# You Can Never Hold Back Spring

You can never hold back spring
you can be sure 
I will never stop believing
the blushing rose that will climb
spring ahead or fall behind
winter dreams the same dream every time
baby you can never hold back spring
even though you've lost your way
the world is dreaming 
dreaming of spring
so close your eyes 
open your heart
to the one who's dreaming of you
you can never hold back spring
remember everything that spring can bring
baby you can never hold back spring

# You Can't Unring a Bell

You can't unring a bell Junior
it'll cost you to get out of this one Junior
she's got big plans that don't include you
take it like a man cause you you can't unring a bell sucker
you'll need an attorney for this journey Junior how's it feel
how do you like it in the slam
you're a little man in a great big town
perhaps you were a little hasty
he he he he he he he
you can't take back the things you said man
cause you can't unring a bell junior
Ah hurts don't it 
take it like a man
get it through your head suffer

# Young At Heart

Fairy tales can come true it can happen to you if you're young at heart
for it's hard you will find to be narrow of mind if you're young at heart
you can go to extremes with impossible schemes
you can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams
and life gets more exciting with each passing day
and love is either in your heart or on its way
don't you know that it's worth every treasure on earth to be young at heart
and as rich as you are it's much better by far to be young at heart
and if you should survive to 105 think of all you've derived out of being alive
then this is the best part you have a head start
if you are among the very young at heart
don't you know that it's worth every treasure on earth to be young at heart
or as rich as you are it's much better by far to be young at heart
and if you should survive to 105 think of all you've derived out of being alive
then this is the best part you have a head start
if you are among the very young at heart
if you are among the very young at heart

# $29.00

Little black girl in a red dress on a hot night with a broken shoe
Little black girl you should've never left home
there's probably someone still waitin' up for you
It's cold back in Chicago but the Los Angeles street is worse
all you got is twenty-nine dollars and an alligator purse
see that vulture in the Fleetwood with the chartreuse hood
sees you're tryin' to get your bearings
say hey baby which way's the main stem
wherever you say you're from he'll say he grew up there himself
he gonna come on and make you feel like you grew up right next door to him
take a left on Central he gonna throw it in reverse
all you got is twenty-nine dollars and an alligator purse
he gonna come on just like a gentleman
and oh baby you're gonna be a little shy
you say your ex-old man was a sax player
he says Baby I used to play bass with Sly
and you say you like his Cadillac
says honey I got two or three
sweetheart you're sure fortunate that you ran into me
you've done a dime in the joint you figure nothin' could be worse
than twenty-nine dollars and an alligator purse
Got Pharoh on 8-track you start smokin' a little boo
thinkin' gettin' out of Chicago was just about
the best thing that's ever happened to you
you startin' to like it already this cat seems to be cool
he says Baby I know a good old jailhouse in West-Hollywood be just right for you
he ain't no good Samaritan he gonna make sure he's reimbursed
a lot more than twenty-nine dollars and an alligator purse
and when the streets get hungry baby and you almost hear em growl
someones savin a place for you when the dogs begin to howl
and the streets are dead they creep up and take whatever's left on the bone
and remember suckers always make mistakes
when they're far away from home
chicken in the pot whoever gets there first is gonna get themselves
twenty-nine dollars and an alligator purse
and the siren's just an epilogue the cops here always get there too late
they always stop for coffee on their way to the scene of the crime
they always try so hard to look just like movie stars
but they couldn't catch a cold
baby don't waste your dime
she's lucky to be alive the doctor whispered to the nurse
she only lost half a pint of blood twenty-nine dollars and an alligator purse

# (Looking For) The Heart Of Saturday Night

Well, you gassed her up, behind the wheel
With your arm around your sweet one in your Oldsmobile
Barreling down the boulevard
You're looking for the heart of Saturday night
And you got paid on Friday, your pockets are jingling
Then you see the lights and you get all tingling
Cause you're cruising with a six
You're looking for the heart of Saturday night
Then you comb your hair, you shave your face
Trying to wipe out every trace
Of all the other days in the week
You know that this'll be the Saturday you're reaching your peak
Stopping on the red, you're going on the green
Cause tonight will be like nothing you've ever seen
And you're barreling down the boulevard
You're looking for the heart of Saturday night
Tell me, is it the crack of the pool balls, neon buzzing
Telephone's ringing, it's your second cousin
Is it the barmaid that's smiling from the corner of her eye
Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye
Makes it kind of quiver down in the core
Cause you're dreaming of them Saturdays that came before
And now you're stumbling
You're stumbling onto the heart of Saturday night
You gassed her up and you're behind the wheel
With your arm around your sweet one in your Oldsmobile
Barreling down the boulevard
You're looking for the heart of Saturday night
Is it the crack of the pool balls, neon buzzing
Telephone's ringing, it's your second cousin
And the barmaid is smiling from the corner of her eye
Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye
Makes it kind of special down in the core
And you're dreaming of them Saturdays that came before
It's found you stumbling
Stumbling onto the heart of Saturday night
And you're stumbling
Stumbling onto the heart of Saturday night

# 16 Shells From A Thirty-Ought Six

I plugged 16 shells from a thirty-ought-six
and the Black Crow snuck through a hole in the sky
so I spent all my buttons on an old pack mule
and I made me a ladder from a pawn shop marimba
and I leaned it up against a dandelion tree
and I filled me a sachel full of old pig corn
and I beat me a billy from an old French horn
and I kicked that mule to the top of the tree and I blew me a hole 'bout the size of a kickdrum
and I cut me a switch from a long branch elbow
I'm gonna whittle you into kindlin'
Black Crow, sixteen shells from a thirty-ought-six
whittle you into kindlin'
Black Crow sixteen shells from a thirty-ought-six
Well I slept in the holler of a dry creek bed
and I tore out the buckets from a red Corvette, 
tore out the buckets from a red Corvette
Lionel and Dave and the Butcher made three
you got to meet me by the knuckles of the skinnybone tree
with the strings of a Washburn stretched like a clothes line
you know me and that mule scrambled right through the hole
I'm gonna whittle you into kindlin'
Black Crow, sixteen shells from a thirty-ought-six
whittle you into kindlin'
Black Crow sixteen shells from a thirty-ought-six
Now I hold him prisoner in a Washburn jail
that strapped on the back of my old kick mule
I bang on the strings just to drive him crazy
I strum it loud to rattle his cage
strum it loud just to rattle his cage
I'm gonna whittle you into kindlin'
Black Crow, sixteen shells from a thirty-ought-six
whittle you into kindlin'
Black Crow sixteen shells from a thirty-ought-six

# 2:19

I lost everything I had in the '29 flood
the barn was buried beneath a mile of mud
now I've got nothing but the whistle and the steam
my baby leaving town on the 2:19
now there's a fellow that's preaching about hell and damnation 
bouncing off the walls in the grand central station
I treated her bad 
I treated her mean
my baby leaving town on the 2:19
I said hey hey 
I don't know what to do
hey hey 
I will remember you
hey hey 
I don't know what to do
my baby leaving town on the 2:19
now I've always been puzzled by the yin and the yang
it'll come out in the wash but it always leaves a stain
sturm and drang
the luster and the sheen
my baby leaving town on the 2:19
lost the baby with the water and the preacher stole the bride
sent her out for a bottle but when she came back inside
she didn't have my whiskey
she didn't have my gin
with a hat full of feathers and a wicked grin
I said hey hey 
I don't know what to do
hey hey 
I will remember you
hey hey 
I don't know what to do
my baby leaving town on the 2:19
on the train you get smaller as you get farther away
the roar covers everything you wanted to say
was that a raindrop in the corner of your eye
were you drying your nails or waving goodbye
I said hey hey 
I don't know what to do
hey hey 
I will remember you
hey hey 
I don't know what to do
my baby leaving town on the 2:19
