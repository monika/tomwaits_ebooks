# A Good Man Is Hard To Find

A good man is hard to find only strangers sleep in my bed
My favorite words are good-bye
And my favorite color is red
I always play Russian Roulette in my head
It's seventeen black and twenty-nine red
How far from the gutter; how far from the pew
I'll always remember to forget about you
A good man is hard to find
Only strangers sleep in my bed
My favorite words are good-bye
And my favorite color is red
A long dead soldier looks out from the frame
No one remembers his war; no one remembers his name
Go out to the meadow; scare off all the crows
It does nothing but rain here, and nothing will grow
A good man is hard to find
Only strangers sleep in my bed
My favorite words are good-bye
And my favorite color is red

# A Little Rain

The Ice Man's mule is parked outside the bar
Where a man with missing fingers plays a strange guitar
And the German dwarf dances with the butcher's son
And a little rain never hurt noone
And a little rain never hurt noone
They're dancing on the roof and the ceiling's coming down
I sleep with my shovel and my leather gloves
A little trouble makes it worth the going
And a little rain never hurt noone
The world is round
And so I'll go around
You must risk something that matters
My hands are strong
I'll take any man here
If it's worth the going
It's worth the ride
She was 15 years old and never seen the ocean
She climbed into a van with a vagabond
And the last thing she said was "I love you mom" 
And a little rain never hurt noone
And a little rain never hurt noone

# A Sight For Sore Eyes

A sight for sore eyes it's a long time no see
Working hard hardly working hey man you know me
Water under the bridge did you see my new car
Well it's bought and it's paid for parked outside of the bar
And hey barkeep what's keeping you keep pouring drinks
For all these palookas hey you know what I thinks
That we toast to the old days and DiMaggio too
And old Drysdale and Mantle Whitey Ford and to you
Oh you know the old gang ain't around everyone has left town
Except for Thumm and Giardina said they just might be down
Oh half drunk all the time and I'm all drunk the rest
Yeah Monk's still the champion oh but I am the best
And hey barkeep what's keeping you keep pouring drinks
For all these palookas hey you know what I thinks
That we toast to the old days and DiMaggio too
And old Drysdale and Mantle Whitey Ford and to you
Guess you heard about Nash he was killed in a crash
Oh that must have been two or three years ago now
Yeah he spun out and he rolled he hit a telephone pole
And he died with the radio on
No she's married with a kid finally split up with Sid
He's up north for a nickel's worth for armed robbery
And I'll play you some pinball no you ain't got a chance
Then go on over and ask her to dance
And hey barkeep what's keeping you keep pouring drinks
For all these palookas hey you know what I thinks
That we toast to the old days and DiMaggio too
And Drysdale and Mantle Whitey Ford and to you

# A Sweet Little Bullet from a Pretty Blue Gun

Well it's raining it's pouring
you didn't bring a sweater
Nebraska will never let you come back home
Now on Hollywood and Vine
by the Thrifty Mart sign
any night I'll be willin to bet
there's a young girl
with sweet little dreams and pretty blue wishes
standin there just gettin all wet
Now there's a place off the drag
called the Gilbert Hotel
and there's a couple letters
burned out in the sign
and it's better than a bus stop
they do good business every time it rains
for little girls with nothing in their jeans
but pretty blue wishes and sweet little dreams
and its raining its pouring
the old man is snoring
now I lay me down to sleep
I hear the sirens in the street
all my dreams are made of chrome
I have no way to get back home
I'd rather die before I wake
like Marilyn Monroe(7)
and you could throw my dreams out in the street
and let the rain make 'em grow
now the night clerk he got a club foot
he's heard every hard luck story
at least a hundred times or more
he says check out time is 10 am
and thats just what it means
go on up the stairs
with sweet little wishes and pretty blue dreams
and it's raining its pouring
and Hollywood's just fine
swindle a little girl out of her dreams
another letter in the sign
now never trust a scarecrow wearin shades after dark
be careful of that old bow tie he wears
it takes a sweet little bullet from a pretty blue gun
to put those scarlet ribbons in your hair
no that ain't no cherry bomb
fourth of July's all done
just some fool playin that second line
from the barrel of a pretty blue gun
o that ain't no cherry bomb
fourth of July's all done
just some fool playin that second line
from the barrel of a pretty blue gun

# Alice

It's dreamy weather we're on
You wave your crooked wand
Along an icy pond
With a frozen moon
A murder of silhouette crows I saw...
And the tears on my face
And the skates on the pond they spell Alice
I'll disappear in your name
But you must wait for me
Somewhere beneath the sea
There's the wreck of a ship
Your hair is like meadow grass
On the tide And the raindrops on my window
And the ice in my drink
Baby, all that I can think of Is Alice
Arithmetic Arithmetock I turn the hands back on the clock
How does the ocean rock the boat
How did the razor find my throat
The only strings that hold me here
Are tangled up around the pier
And so a secret kiss
Brings madness with the bliss
And I will think of this
When I'm dead in my grave
Set me adrift and I'm lost over there
But I must be insane
To go skating on your name
And by tracing it twice
I fell through the ice Of Alice
There's only Alice

# All Stripped Down

Well the time will come
When the wind will shout
All stripped down 
All stripped down
And all the sinners know
What I'm talking about
All stripped down 
All stripped down
When all the creatures of the world
Are gonna line up at the gate
All stripped down All stripped down
And you better be on time
And you better not be late
All stripped 
All stripped down
Well, you know in your heart
What you gotta bring
All stripped down
All stripped down
No big mink coat
No diamond ring
All stripped down 
All stripped down
Well take off your paint
And take off your rouge
All stripped down 
All stripped down
Let your backbone flip
And let your spirit shine thru
I want you all stripped
All stripped
All stripped down
All the men we got
Well they're goin' down the drain
All stripped down 
All stripped down
And when I see your sadness
On a river of shame
All stripped down 
All stripped down
You got to raise up
Both the quick and the dead
All stripped down 
All stripped down
With no shoes on your feet
No hat on your head
I want you all stripped 
All stripped 
All stripped down
Ain't nothin' in my heart
But fire for you
All stripped down 
All stripped down
With my rainy hammer
And a heart that's true
All stripped 
All stripped down

#All The World Is Green

I fell into the ocean
When you became my wife
I risked it all against the sea
To have a better life
Marie you're the wild blue sky
And men do foolish things
You turn kings into beggars
And beggars into kings
Pretend that you owe me nothing
And all the world is green
We can bring back the old
days again
And all the world is green
The face forgives the mirror
The worm forgives the plow
The questions begs the answer
Can you forgive me somehow
Maybe when our story's over
We'll go where it's always spring
The band is playing our song again
And all the world is green
Pretend that you owe me nothing
And all the world is green
We can bring back the old
days again
And all the world is green
The moon is yellow silver
Oh the things that summer brings
It's a love you'd kill for
And all the world is green
He is balancing a diamond
On a blade of grass
The dew will settle on our grave
When all the world is green

# Altar Boy

He's an ol' altar boy lying out there in the street
he's an ol' altar boy bound up in leather and chains
that's why I'm feeling so blue
I'm an old altar boy
what about you
now I can order in Latin
make 'em au gratin Joe
I'm an old altar boy
that's why I'm so depressed
I never got the rest of the dream
just the ritual
now I'm habitual
majoring in crimes 
that are unspeakable
cause I'm an old altar boy
that's what happened to me
I'm an old altar boy
he's hoping he can meet a woman 
dressed like a nun
he knows there's got to be some around here
drinking across from the church
a little Father Cribari wine
on a Sunday morn' time
I'm an old altar boy
why is he winking at this time in his life
he never took a wife 
cause he's an old altar boy
oh yeah
what about you

# Another Man's Vine

Bougainvillea's bloom and wind
Be careful mind the strangle vines
The rose is climbing over blind
Cause the sun is on the other side
The bees will find their honey
The sweetest every time
Around a Red Rose
I see a red rose, a red rose
Blooming on another man's vine
Golden Willie's gone to war
He left his young wife on the shore
Will she be steadfast everyday?
While Golden Willie is far away
Along the way her letters end
She never reads what Willie sends
Now I see a red rose
I smell a red rose
A red rose
Blooming on another man's vine

# Around a Red Rose

I see a red rose, a red rose
Blooming on another man's vine
Golden Willie's gone to war
He left his young wife on the shore
Will she be steadfast everyday?
While Golden Willie is far away
Along the way her letters end
She never reads what Willie sends
Now I see a red rose
I smell a red rose
A red rose
Blooming on another man's vine
Anywhere I Lay My Head
My head is spinning round
My heart is in my shoes
I went and set the Thames on fire
Now I must come back down
She's laughing in her sleeve at me
I can feel it in my bones
But anywhere I'm gonna 
Lay my head, boys
I'm will call my home
Well I see that 
The world is upside down
My pockets were filled up with gold
Now the clouds have covered o'er
And the wind is blowing cold
I don't need anybody
Because I learned to be alone
And anywhere 
I lay my head, boys
I will call my home

# Army Ants

The whirligig beetles are wary and fast 
with an organ to detect the ripples
the arachnid moths lay their eggs inside 
other insects along the borders of fields or roads 
in clusters of white cocoons
the ribbed pine borer is a longhorn beetle 
their antenna's are half the length of their body 
and they feed on dead red pine
robber flies with their immobile heads
inject a paralyzing fluid into their prey 
that they snatch from life in mid-air
the snow flea's mode of locomotion
strange and odd 
with a spiny tail mechanism with hooks 
and a protracted tube from the abdomen 
to enable moisture absorption
the female praying mantis devours the male 
while they are mating 
the male sometimes continues copulating 
even after the female has bitten off his head 
and part of his upper torso
every night wasps bite into the stem of a plant
lock their mandibles into position
stretch out at right angles to the stem and
with legs dangling they fall asleep
if one places a minute amount of liquor 
on a scorpion
it will instantly go mad and 
sting itself to death
the bombardier beetle 
when disturbed 
defends itself by emitting a series of explosions
sometimes setting off four or five reports in succession
the noises sound like miniature popgun blasts 
and are accompanied by a cloud of 
reddish coloured vile smelling fluid
it is commonly known that ants keep slaves
certain species 
the so-called sanguinary ants 
in particular
will raid the nests of other ant tribes 
and kill the queen and then kidnap many of the workers
the workers are brought back to the captor's hive 
where they are coerced into performing menial tasks
and as we discussed last semester 
the army ants will leave nothing but your bones
perhaps you've encountered some of these insects 
in your communities 
displaying both their predatory and defense characteristics
while embedded within the walls of flesh 
and passing for what is most commonly recognized
as human

# Baby Gonna Leave Me

Well I stood on the corner
Til my feet got wet
I stood by the faucet
Till the sink filled up
I stood by the window
Till the moon came up
My baby bought a ticket
Long as my clothes line
Na na na na na
My baby went and left me
In a '49 Ford
Going down the highway in a
49 sword
my baby ripped my heart out
with every turn of the moon
somebody told me there's
never been a rose without a thorn
na na na na na na
na na na na na na
And if I was a tree
I'd be a cut down tree
And if I was a bed 
I'd be an unmade bed
I'll get my 32/20 and it'll
Have to do
Na na na na na na
Gone like the wind in 
The meadow
And the rain on the hill
You even left your lipstick
And your powder and your blush
Baby gonna leave me
On a Grey Hound Bus
The stars are melting
All across the sky
Na na na na na 
I let the dog out
But he didn't come back
Stood on the corner till
My feet got wet
Baby gonna leave me in a 49 Ford
I stood by the window
Till the moon came up
Na na na na na 
Na na na na na

#Back In The Crowd

If you don’t want these arms to hold you
If you don’t want these lips to kiss you
If you’ve found somebody new
Put me back in the crowd
Put the sun behind the clouds
Put me back in the crowd
There’s a battle going on
Between the blue and the grey
And if you don’t want my love
Don’t make me stay
Take back your name
Take back these wings
Take my picture from the frame
And put me back in the crowd
Put the sun behind the cloud
Put me back in the crowd
Put me back in the crowd
Put the sun behind the cloud
Put me back in the crowd

#Back In The Good Old World

When I was a boy, the moon was a pearl the sun a yellow gold.
But when I was a man, the wind blew cold the hills were upside down.
But now that I have gone from here there's no place I'd rather be than to float my chances on the tide, back in the good old world.
On October's last I'll fly back home rolling down winding way.
Scare crows are all dressed in rags out at the edge of the field I lay and all I've got's a pocket full of flowers on my grave.
Oh but summer is gone I remember it best back in the good old world

# Bad As Me

You’re the head on the spear
You’re the nail on the cross
You’re the fly in my beer
You’re the key that got lost
You’re the letter from Jesus on the bathroom wall
You’re mother superior in only a bra
You’re the same kind of bad as me
I’m the hat on the bed
I’m the coffee instead
The fish or cut bait
I’m the detective up late
I’m the blood on the floor
The thunder and the roar
The boat that won’t sink
I just won’t sleep a wink
You’re the same kind of bad as me
No good you say
Well that’s good enough for me
You’re the wreath that caught fire
You’re the preach to the choir
You bite down on the sheet
But your teeth have been wired
You skid in the rain
You’re trying to shift
You’re grinding the gears
You’re trying to shift
And you’re the same kind of bad as me
They told me you were no good
I know you’ll take care of all my needs
You’re the same kind of bad as me
I’m the mattress in the back
I’m the old gunnysack
I’m the one with the gun
Most likely to run
I’m the car in the weeds
If you cut me I’ll bleed
You’re the same kind of bad as me
You’re the same kind of bad as me

# Bad Liver And A Broken Heart

Well I got a bad liver and a broken heart
yea I drunk me a river since you tore me apart
and I don't have a drinking problem 
cept when I can't get a drink
and I wish you'd a known her 
we were quite a pair
she was sharp as a razor 
and soft as a prayer
so welcome to the continuing saga
she was my better half 
and I was just a dog
and so here am I slumped
I been chippied and I been chumped 
on my stool
so buy this fool, some spirits and libations
it's these railroad station bars
with all these conductors and the porters
and I'm all out of quarters
and this epitaph is the aftermath
yea I choose my path 
hey come on Cath, he's a lawyer 
he ain't the one for ya
and no the moon ain't romantic 
it's intimidating as hell
and some guy's tryin to sell 
me a watch
and so I'll meet you at the 
bottom of a bottle of 
bargain scotch
I got me a bottle and a dream
it's so maudlin it seems
you can name your poison
go on ahead and make some noise 
I ain't sentimental
this ain't a purchase it's a rental 
and it's purgatory, hey 
what's your story, well 
I don't even care
cause I got my own double-cross to bear
and I'll see your Red Label 
and I'll raise you one more
and you can pour me a cab 
I just can't drink no more
cause it don't douse the flames
that are started by dames 
it ain't like asbestos
it don't do nothing but 
rest us assured
and substantiate the rumors 
that you've heard

# Barber Shop

Good morning mister snip snip snip
With your hair cut just as short as mine
Good morning mister snip snip snip
With your hair cut just as short as mine
Bay rum lucky tiger butch wax cracker jacks
Shoe shine jaw breaker magazine racks
Hanging round the barber shop a side-burning close crop
Morning Mr. Furgeson what's the good word with you
Staying out of trouble like a good boy should
I see you're still cutting hair I'm still cutting classes
I got a couple passes to the ringle bros barn bail circus afternoon
You lost a little round the middle and you're looking real good
Sitting on the wagon instead of under the hood
What's the low-down Mr. Brown I heard your boy's leaving town
I bought myself a struggle buggy sucker's powder blue
Throw me over the sports page Cincinnati looking good
I always been for Pittsburgh and I lay you 10 to 1
The Pirates get the pennant and the series before their done
The hair's getting longer you know the skirts are getting shorter
And don't you know that you can get a cheaper haircut 
If you wanna cross the border
If your mama saw you smoking well she'd kick your ass
Now you put it out you juvenile and put it out fast
Well if I had a million dollars what would I do
I'd probably be a barber not a bum like you
Still got your paper route now that's just fine
And you can pay me double because you gypped me last time
And don't you know that you can keep a little circus money 
And spend it on a girl
And just remember that I give the best haircuts 
In the whole wide world
I give the best haircuts in the whole wide world
Good morning mister snip snip snip
With your hair cut just as short as mine
Good morning mister snip snip snip
With your hair cut just as short as mine

# Barcarolle

A cloud lets go of the moon
Her ribbons are all out of tune
She's skating on the ice in a glass
And in the hands of a man
That she kissed on a train
The children have all gone into town
To get candy and we are
Alone in the house here
And your eyes fall down on me
And I belong only to you
The water is filling my shoes
In the wine of my heart there's a stone
In a well made of bone I will bring to the pond
And she's here in your pocket
And curled up in a dollar
And the chain from your watch
Around her neck
And I'll stay right here till it's time
The girls all knit in the shade
Before the baby is made
The branches bend down to the ground
Here to swing on
And I'm lost in the blond summer grass
And the train whistle blows
And the carnival goes
Till there's only the tickets and crows
But the grass will all grow back
And the branches Spell Alice
And I belong to you

# Bend Down The Branches

The sky is as deep as it can be
bend down the branches
close your eyes and you will see
bend down the branches
you're like a willow
once you were gold
we're made for bending
even beauty gets old
climb the stairs they're not so steep
bend down the branches
close your eyes and go to sleep
bend down the branches

# Better Off Without A Wife

All my friends are married
Every Tom and Dick and Harry
You must be strong if you're to go it alone
Here's to the bachelors and the Bowery bums
Those who feel that they're the ones
That are better off without a wife
Cause I like to sleep until the crack of noon
Midnight howling at the moon
Going out when I want to,
And I'm coming home when I please
Don't have to ask permission
If I wanna go out fishing
Never have to ask for the keys
I've never been no Valentino
But I had a girl who lived in Reno
Left me for a trumpet player
Well, it didn't get me down
He was wanted for assault
And though he said it weren't his fault
You know the coppers rode him right out of town
I'll be sleeping until the crack of noon
Midnight howling at the moon
And I'll be going out when I want to
Coming home when I please
Don't have to ask permission
If I wanna go out fishing
Never have to ask for the keys
Yeah, you see I'm kinda selfish about my privacy
Now as long as I can be with me
We get along so well I can't even believe it
I love to chew the fat with folks
I'll be listening to all your dirty jokes
I'm so thankful for these friends I do receive
I'll be sleeping until the crack of noon
Midnight howling at the moon
And I'll be going out when I want to
Coming home when I please
Don't have to ask permission
If I wanna go out fishing
Never have to ask for the keys, no
Hey, I got this girl I know, man, and I just
She's been married several times and
I don't wanna end up like her
I mean, she's been married so many times
She's got rice-marks all over her face
Yeah, you know the kind

# Big Black Mariah

Big Black Mariah
Cuttin' through the cane break 
Rattling the sill
Thunder that the rain makes 
When the shadow tops the hill
Big light on the back street 
Hill to Evermore. Packin' down the ladder 
With the hammer to the floor
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Ford
Well he's all boxed up 
On a red bell dame
Hunted Black Johnny with 
A blind man's cane
A yellow bullet with a 
Rag out in the wind
An old blind tiger 
Get an old bell Jim
Here comes the Big Black 
Mariah. Here comes the Big Black 
Mariah. Here comes the Big Black 
Mariah. Here comes the Big Black Ford
Sent to the skies on a 
Benny Jag Blue
Off to bed without his supper 
Like the Linda brides do
Now he's got to do the story 
With the old widow Jones...
He's got a wooden coat this boy 
Is never coming home
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Mariah
Here comes the Big Black Ford
Cut through the 
Cane break...
Well he's all boxed up 
On a red bell dame
Hunted Black Johnny with

A yellow bullet with a 
Rag out in the wind
An old blind tiger 
Get an old bell Jim

# Big Joe And Phantom 309

See, I just happened to be back on the East coast a few years back
I was trying to make me a buck like everybody else
I'll be damned if times didn't get hard, and Christ I got down on my luck
And I got tired of just roaming and bumming around
So I started thumbing my way back to my old hometown
And you know, I made quite a few miles in the first couple of days
You know, I figured I'd be home in a week if my luck held out this way
You know, it was the third night, oh and I got stranded
And it was out at a cold lonely crossroads
And as the rain came pouring down, man I was hungry
Yeah, I was hungry, tired and freezing, caught myself a chill
But it was just about that time
Yeah, it was just about that time that the lights of an old semi topped the hill
You should've seen me smile when I heard them air brakes come on
Yeah, and I climbed up into that cab where I knew it'd be warm
At the wheel... well, at the wheel sat a big man
And I'd have to say he must've weighed two ten
As he stuck out a big hand and he said with a grin
'Big Joe's the name, and this here rig is called Phantom 309'
Well, I asked him why he called his rig such a name
And you know, he turned to me and said 
'Why son, don't you know this here rig'll be putting 'em all to shame
Nah, there ain't a driver
No, there ain't a driver on this or any other line for that matter that
That's seen nothing but the taillights of Big Joe and Phantom 309'
So we rode and we talked the better part of the night
And I told my stories and Joe told his
And I smoked up all his Viceroys as we rolled along
Pushed her ahead with ten forward gears
Man, that dashboard was lit like the old Madame La Rue pinball
Serious semi-truck
'Til almost mysteriously
Well, it was the lights of a truck stop that rolled into sight
Joe turned to me, said 'I'm sorry son, but I'm afraid this is just as far as you go, you see
You see, I kinda gotta be making a turn just up the road a piece'
I'll be damned if he didn't toss me a dime as he threw her in low and said
'Go on in there son, and get yourself a hot cup of coffee on Big Joe'
I mean to tell you, when Joe and his rig pulled off into the night
Man, in nothing flat they was clean outta sight
So I walked into this stop, well I ordered me up a cup of mud
Saying 'Big Joe's setting this dude up'
But it got so deadly quiet in that place
Yeah, it got so deadly quiet in that place, you could've heard a pin drop
And as the waiter's face turned kind of pale I said
'What's the matter, did I say something wrong?'
I kind of said with a half way grin
He said, 'No son, you see it'll kinda happen every now and then
'Cause every driver in here knows Big Joe, son, but
But let me tell you what happened just ten years ago out there
Yeah, it was years ago, out there at that cold lonely crossroads
And there was a whole busload of kids
And then they were just coming from school
And they were right in the middle when Joe topped the hill and
They could've been slaughtered except Joe turned his wheels
And he jackknifed, yeah he jackknifed, and he went into a skid
And you know, folks around here, well
They say he gave his life to save that bunch of kids
And out there at that cold lonely crossroads
Well, they're saying it was the end of the line for Big Joe and Phantom 309
But it's funny you know, cause... cause every now and then
Yeah, every now and then when the moon's holding water
Well, they say that old Joe'll stop and give you a ride
It seems, just like you, some hitchhiker will be coming by'
'So here, son,' he said to me, 'you get yourself another cup of coffee
It's on the house, I kind of want you to hang on to that dime
Yeah, I kind of want you to hang on to that dime as a souvenir
I want you to keep that dime as a souvenir of Big Joe
Of Big Joe and Phantom
Big Joe and Phantom 309'

# Black Market Baby

She lives in a house
that's way back off the road
There's a man with a lantern
and he carries her soul
A coal stove and a bed
A skillet and a hound
She drove a camel through
A needle
In this sinking board walk town
She's my Black Market baby
She's my Black Market baby
She's a diamond that
wants to stay coal
wants to stay coal
I swang out wide with her
on hells iron gate
Anything that you wanted 
you could have
My eyes say their prayers to her
sailors ring her bell
Like a moth mistakes a light bulb
For the moon and goes to hell
She's my Black Market baby
She's my Black Market baby
She's a diamond that
wants to stay coal
wants to stay coal
There's no prayer like desire
There's amnesia in her kiss
She's a swan and a pistol
and she will follow you like this
In Moberly, Missouri at the
Iroquois Hotel 
She checked in with the President
and she ran up quite a Bill
(Chorus)
She's whiskey in a teacup
She gives blondes a lousy name
She's a Bonzai Aphrodite
and a ticket back to Spain
She's a hard way to go
and there ain't no way
to stop
Every time you play the red
the black is coming up
She's my Black Market baby
She's my Black Market baby
She's a diamond that
Wants to stay coal
Wants to stay coal

#The Black Rider

Come on along with the Black Rider
We'll have a gay old time
Lay down in the web of the black spider
I'll drink your blood like wine
So come on in
it ain't no sin
take off your skin
and dance around in your bones
So come on along with the Black Rider
We'll have a gay old time
Anchors away with the Black Rider
I'll drink your blood like wine
I'll drop you off in Harlem with the Black Rider
Out where the bullets shine
And when you're done
you cock your gun
the blood will run
like ribbons through your hair
So come on along with the Black Rider
We'll have a gay old time
Come on along with the Black Rider
I've got just the thing for thee
Come on along with the Black Rider
I want your company
I'll have the veal
a lovely meal
that's how I feel
May I use your skull for a bowl
Come on along with the Black Rider
We'll have a gay old time

# Black Wings

Take an eye for an eye
Take a tooth for a tooth
Just like they say in the Bible
Never leave a trace or forget a face
Of any man at the table
Any man at the table
When the moon is a cold chiseled dagger
Sharp enough to draw blood from a stone
He rides through your dreams on a coach 
And horses and the fence posts 
In the moonlight look like bones.
Well they've stopped trying to hold him
With mortar, stone and chain
He broke out of every prison
Boots mount the staircase
The door is flung back open
He's not there for he has risen,
He's not there for he has risen
Well he once killed a man with a guitar string
He's been seen at the table with kings
Well he once saved a baby from drowning
There are those that say beneath his coat there are wings
Some say they fear him
Others admire him
Because he steals his promise
One look in his eye
Everyone denies
Ever having met him
Ever having met him
He can turn himself into a stranger
Well they broke a lot of canes on his hide
He was born away in a cornfield
A fever beats in his head like a drum inside
Some say they fear him
Others admire him
Because he steals his promise
One look in his eye
Everyone denies
Ever having met him
Ever having met him

# Blind Love

Now you're gone
And it's hotels and whiskey and sad luck dames
and I don't care if they miss me
and I never remember their names
they say if you get far enough away
you'll be on your way back home
well I'm at the station
and I can't get on the train
it must be blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
Blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
With your blind love
With your blind love
Stone blind love
With your blind love
Now the streets are turning blue
and the dogs are barking 
and the night has come
and there are tears that are falling
from your blue eyes now
Well I wonder where you are
and I whisper your name
The only way to find you
is if I close my eyes
I'll find you with my blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
It's your blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
Stone blind love
Only kind of love is stone blind love
With your blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
Stone blind love
Stone blind love
Oh it's blind love
Blind love
The only kind of love is stone blind love
With your blind love
Oh it's blind love
Blind love
With your stone blind love

# Blow Wind Blow

Mary's on the black top
There's a husband in 
the dog house
In the middle of a shakedown
She got 
quiet as a church mouse
She found Raleigh's on 
the dashboard
Sugar daddy caught a polocar
Ain't no solitary 
tap dance way down here
I swear I's ridin
on a field mouse
we were dancin' in the slaughterhouse
If you swing along the beltway
then you skid along the all day
cause I went a little crazy
and I sat upon a high chair
And I'm smokin like a diesel
way out here
Blow wind blow- blow me away here-
blow wind blow (repeat)

# Blue Valentines

She sends me blue valentines all the way from Philadelphia
to mark the anniversary of someone that I used to be
And it feels like a warrant is out for my arrest
baby you got me checkin in my rearview mirror
thats why I'm always on the run it's why I changed my name
and I didn't think you'd ever find me here
to send me blue valentines like half forgotten dreams
like a pebble in my shoe as I walk these streets
and the ghost of your memory baby its the thistle in the kiss
its the burglar that can break a rose's neck
its the tatooed broken promise I gotta hide beneath my sleeve
I'm gonna see you every time I turn my back
oh you send me blue valentines though I try to remain at large
they're insisting that our love must have a eulogy
why do I save all this madness here in the nightstand drawer
there to haunt upon my shoulders
baby I know I'd be luckier to walk around everywhere I go
with this blind and broken heart
that sleeps beneath my lapel
instead these blue valentines to remind me of my cardinal sin
i can never wash the guilt or get these bloodstains off my hands
and it takes a whole lot of whiskey to make these nightmares go away
and I cut my bleedin heart out every night and I'm gonna die just a little more
on each St. Valentine's day
don't you remember I promised I would write you
these blue valentines
blue valentines
blue valentines

# Bone Chain

She drove a big old Lincoln 
with suicide doors
and a sewing machine in the back
and a light bulb that looked like 
an alligator egg
was mounted up front on the hood
and she had an Easter bonnet that had been signed 
by Tennessee Ernie Ford
and she always had saw dust in her hair
and she cut two holes in the back of her dress
and she had these scapular wings
that were covered with feathers and electrical tape
and when she got good and drunk
she would sing about Elkheart, Indiana
where the wind is strong 
and folks mind their own business
and she had at least a hundred old baseballs 
that she'd taken from kids
and she collected bones of all kinds
and she lived in a trailer under a bridge
and she made her own whiskey and gave cigarettes to kids
and she'd been struck by lightning seven or eight times
and she hated the mention of rain
and she made up her own language
and she wore rubber boots
and she could fix anything with string
and her lips were like cherries
and she was stronger than any man
and she smelled like gasoline and root beer fizz
and she put mud on a bee sting 
I got at the creek
and she gave me 
my very first kiss
and she gave me 
my very first kiss
talking 'bout my little Kathleen
she's just a fine young thing
someday she'll wear my ring
my little Kathleen

# Books Of Moses

Books of Moses
bringing stone news
wet in the water
weeping in the sun
Books of Moses
got some splinters 
didn't you?
Books of Moses 
brought me right here 
back to you
flaming heart 
ain't it sweet
lighting the world 
at your feet
Books of Moses 
myth and truth
Books of Moses
bring me back to you
hero's welcome
there stands your king
where the serpent shudders
and the angels sing
Books of Moses
happening again
yes he knows us
well welcome him
your friend
Books of Moses
bringing stone news
wet is the water
blood covering the sun
Books of Moses 
myth and truth
Books of Moses
bring me back to you

# Bottom Of The World

my daddy told me looking back
the best friend you'll have is a railroad track
so when I was 13 said I'm rolling my own
I'm leaving Missouri and I'm never coming home
I'm lost and I'm lost
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
Satchel Pudding and Lord God Mose
sitting by the fire with a busted nose
that fresh egg yeller is too damn rare
but the white part is perfect for slicking down your hair
I'm lost and I'm lost
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
Blackjack Ruby and Nimrod Cain
the moon is the color of a coffee stain
Jesse Frank and Birdy Joe Hoaks
but who is the king of all these folks
I'm lost and I'm lost
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
well I dined last night with Scarface Ron
on tilapia fish cakes and fried black swan
razor weed onion and peacock squirrel
and I dreamed all night about a beautiful girl
I'm lost and I'm lost
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
god's green hair is where I slept last
he balanced a diamond on a blade of grass
now I woke me up with a cardinal bird
and when I want to talk he hangs on every word
and I'm lost and I'm lost
I'm lost at the bottom of the world
I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar
I'm lost at the bottom of the world

# The Briar And The Rose

I fell asleep down by the stream
And there I had the strangest dream
And down by Brennan's Glenn there grows
A briar and a rose
There's a tree in the forest
But I don't know where
I built a nest out of your hair
And climbing up into the air
A briar and a rose
I don't know how long it has been
But I was born in Brennan's Glenn
And near the end of spring there grows
A briar and a rose
I picked the rose one early morn
I pricked my finger on a thorn
They'd grown so high
It's winding wove the briar around the rose
I tried to tear them both apart
I felt a bullet in my heart
And all dressed up in springs new clothes
The briar and the rose
And when I'm buried in my grave
Tell me so I will know
Your tears will fall
To make love grow
The briar and the rose

# Broken Bicycles

Broken bicycles 
old busted chains
with rusted handlebars 
out in the rain
somebody must have 
an orphanage for
all these things that 
nobody wants any more
September is reminding July
it's time to be saying goodbye
summer is gone 
but our love will remain
like old broken bicycles 
out in the rain
broken bicycles 
don't tell my folks
there's all those playing cards 
pinned to the spokes
laid down like skeletons 
out on the lawn
the wheels won't turn 
when the other has gone
the seasons can turn on a dime
somehow I forget every time
for all the things that 
you've given me 
will always stay
broken but I'll never throw them away

# Burma Shave
Licorice tattoo turned a gun metal blue
Scrawled across the shoulders of a dying town
Took the one eyed jacks across the railroad tracks
And the scar on its belly pulled a stranger passing through
He's a juvenile delinquent never learned how to behave
But the cops would never think to look in Burma-Shave
And the road was like a ribbon and the moon was like a bone
He didn't seem to be like any guy she'd ever known
He kind of looked like Farley Granger with his hair slicked back
She says I'm a sucker for a fella in a cowboy hat
How far are you going?
Said Depends on what you mean
He says I'm only stopping here to get some gasoline
I guess I'm going thataway just as long as it's paved
And I guess you'd say I'm on my way to Burma Shave
And with her knees up on the glove compartment
She took out her barrettes and her hair spilled out like root beer
And she popped her gum and arched her back
Hell Marysville ain't nothing but a wide spot in the road
Some nights my heart pounds like thunder
Don't know why it don't explode
Cause everyone in this stinking town's got one foot in the grave
And I'd rather take my chances out in Burma Shave
Presley's what I go by why don't you change the stations
Count the grain elevators in the rearview mirror
She said mister anywhere you point this thing
It got to beat the hell out of the sting
Of going to bed with every dream that dies here every mornin
And so drill me a hole with a barber pole
And I'm jumping my parole just like a fugitive tonight
Why don't you have another swig and pass that car if you're so brave
I wanna get there before the sun comes up in Burma Shave
And the spider web crack and the mustang screamed
The smoke from the tires and the twisted machine
Just a nickel's worth of dreams and every wishbone that they saved
Lie swindled from them on the way to Burma Shave
And the sun hit the derrick and cast a bat wing shadow
Up against the car door on the shotgun side
And when they pulled her from the wreck
You know she still had on her shades
They say that dreams are growing wild
Just this side
Of Burma Shave

# Buzz Fledderjohn

I stood on the roof of Stuart's old Dodge
to get a better look at the Fledderjohn's lodge
bait shop pistols 
and ammo too
Nothing but books 
about World War II
rottweiler doberman
a Pinkerton guard
I ain't allowed in Buzz Fledderjohn's yard
I ain't allowed
no I ain't allowed
I said I ain't allowed in Buzz Fledderjohn's yard
I seen a python swallowing a Dobermann whole
piranha swimming in a mixing bowl
paper is full of stabbings 
the sky's full of crows
she's singing in Italian 
while she's hanging out her clothes
carp in the bathtub 
and it's raining real hard
I ain't allowed in Buzz Fledderjohn's yard
I said that I ain't allowed
no I ain't allowed
no I ain't allowed in Buzz Fledderjohn's yard
well a sailor's ringing doorbells 
the sinner's in the pew
weather vane squeaking to the west
I seen the cliffs of Dover 
and the deepest ocean blue
one thing in the world I can't recommend to you
cause I ain't allowed
I said I ain't allowed
no I ain't allowed in Buzz Fledderjohn's yard
I said I ain't allowed
no I ain't allowed
I ain't allowed in Buzz Fledderjohn's yard
I ain't allowed
I ain't allowed
I said I ain't allowed in Buzz Fledderjohn's yard

# Candy Apple Red

I don't care if she never comes back
Sing: Candy Apple Red
And I'll never fall in love again
And that's for sure
Sing: Candy Apple Red.
I'm gonna drink just like a son of a bitch
Sing: Candy Apple Red
And drive my car into a drainage ditch
Singing: Candy Apple Red.

# Chicago

The seeds are planted here
But they won’t grow
We won’t have to say goodbye
If we all go
Maybe things will be better in Chicago
To leave all we’ve ever known
For a place we’ve never seen
Maybe things will be better in Chicago
Well It’s braver to stay
Even braver to go
Wherever she goes I go
Maybe things will be better in Chicago
What we need the lord will give us
All we want we carry with us
You know where I can be found
Where the rainbow hits the ground
I’m not alone
I’m not afraid
This bird has flown from his cage
There’s so much magic we have known
On this sapphire we call home
With my coat and my hat
I say goodbye to all that
Maybe things will be better in Chicago
Maybe things will be better in Chicago

# Children's Story

Once upon a time there was a poor child
with no father and no mother
and everything was dead
and no one was left in the whole world
everything was dead
and the child went on search day and night
and since nobody was left on the earth
he wanted to go up into the heavens
and the moon was looking at him so friendly
and when he finally got to the moon
the moon was a piece of rotten wood
and then he went to the sun
and when he got there 
the sun was a wilted sunflower
and when he got to the stars
they were little golden flies
stuck up there like the shrike 
sticks 'em on a blackthorn
And when he wanted to go back down to earth
the earth was an overturned piss pot
And he was all alone 
he sat down and he cried
and he is there till this day
all alone
okay there's your story
night night

# Chocolate Jesus

Don't go to church on Sunday
Don't get on my knees to pray
Don't memorize the books of the Bible
I got my own special way
But I know Jesus loves me
maybe just a little bit more
I fall on my knees every Sunday
At Zerelda Lee's candy store
Well it's got to be a chocolate Jesus
Make me feel good inside
Got to be a chocolate Jesus
Keep me satisfied
Well I don't want no Abba Zabba
Don't want no Almond Joy
There ain't nothing better
suitable for this boy
Well it's the only thing
that can pick me up
Better than a cup of gold
See only a chocolate Jesus
can satisfy my soul
When the weather gets rough
and it's whiskey in the shade
it's best to wrap your savior
up in cellophane
He flows like the big muddy
but that's ok
Pour him over ice cream
for a nice parfait
Well it's got to be a chocolate Jesus
good enough for me
Got to be a chocolate Jesus 
good enough for me
Well it's got to be a chocolate Jesus
make me feel good inside
Got to be a chocolate Jesus 
Keep me satisfied

# Christmas Card from a Hooker in Minneapolis

Hey Charlie I'm pregnant and living on 9th Street
right above a dirty bookstore off Euclid Avenue
and I stopped takin dope and I quit drinkin whiskey
and my old man plays the trombone and works out at the track
he says that he loves me even though it's not his baby
he says that he'll raise him up like he would his own son
and he gave me a ring that was worn by his mother
and he takes me out dancin every Saturday night
and hey Charlie I think about you everytime I pass a fillin station
on account of all the grease you used to wear in your hair
and I still have that record of Little Anthony and the Imperials
but someone stole my record player now how do you like that?
hey Charlie I almost went crazy after Mario got busted
I went back to Omaha to live with my folks
but everyone I used to know was either dead or in prison
so I came back to Minneapolis this time I think I'm gonna stay
hey Charlie I think I'm happy for the first time since my accident
and I wish I had all the money we used to spend on dope
I'd buy me a used car lot and I wouldn't sell any of em
I'd just drive a different car every day dependin on how I feel
hey Charlie for chrissakes if you want to know the truth of it
I don't have a husband he don't play the trombone
I need to borrow money to pay this lawyer and Charlie hey
I'll be eligible for parole come Valentine's day

# Circus

We put up our tent on a dark
Green knoll, outside of town by
The train tracks and a seagull dump
Topping the bill was Horse Face Ethel
And her Marvelous Pigs in satin
We pounded our steaks in the ground
All powder brown
And the branches spread like scary
Fingers reaching – we
Were in a pasture in Kankakee
And one eyed Myra, the queen of
The galley who trained the
Ostrich and the camels
She looked at me squinty with her 
One good eye in a Roy Orbison
t-shirt as she bottle fed
an Orangutan named
Tripod and then there was
Yodeling Elaine the
Queen of the air who wore a 
Dollar sign medallion and she
Had a tiny bubble of spittle
Around her nostril and a 
Little rusty tear, for she had
Lassoed and lost another
Tipsy sailor and over in
The burnt yellow tent
By the frozen tractor, the
Music was like electric sugar
And Zuzu Bolin played
"Stavin' Chain" and Mighty
Tiny on the saw and he
Threw his head back with a 
Mouth full of gold teeth
And they played lopsided heart
And moon over Dog Street and
By the time they played Moanin Low
I was soakin wet and wild eyed
And Doctor Bliss slipped me a 
Preparation and I fell asleep with
Livery Stable Blues in my ear
And me and Molly Hoey drank
Pruno and Koolaid she had a 
Tattoo gun made out of a cassette
Motor and a guitar string and 
she soaked a hanky in 3 roses
and rubbed it on the spot
and she drew a rickety heart and 
a bent arrow and it hurt like hell
and Funeral Wells spun
Poodle Murphy on the target
As he threw his hardware, only
Once in Sheboygan did he miss
At a matinee on Diamond Pier and
She'd never let him forget it
They were doing two shows and she
Had a high fever and he took
Off a piece of her ear and 
Tip Little told her she should
Leave the bum but
Poodle said, "he fetched me
Last time I run" and I'd 
Like to hammer this ring into
A bullet and I wish I
Had some whiskey and a gun
My dear, I wish I had some
Whiskey and a gun my dear

# Clang Boom Steam

Well my baby's so fine
Even her car looks good
From behind
Well my baby's so fine
Even her car looks good
From behind
But the train that took
My baby...
It went clang, boom and steam

# Clap Hands

Sane, sane, they're all insane
The fireman's blind, the conductor's lame
A Cincinnati jacket and a sad luck dame
Hanging out the window with a bottle full of rain
Clap hands. Clap hands
Clap hands. Clap hands
Said roar, roar the thunder and the roar
Son of a bitch is never comin' back here no more
Moon in the window, a bird on the pole
Can always find a millionaire to shovel all the coal
Clap hands. Clap hands
Clap hands. Clap hands
Steam, steam a hundred bad dreams
Goin' up to Harlem with a pistol in his jeans
A fifty dollar bill inside of Palladin's hat
And nobody's sure where Mr. Knickerbocker's at
Said roar, roar the thunder and the roar
Son of a bitch is never comin' back here no more
Moon in the window, a bird on the pole
Can always find a millionaire to shovel all the coal
Clap hands. Clap hands
Clap hands. Clap hands
Shine, shine a Roosevelt dime
All the way to Baltimore and runnin' out of time
Salvation Army seemed to wind up in the hole
They all went to Heaven in a little row boat
Clap hands. Clap hands
Clap hands. Clap hands

# Cold Cold Ground

Crest fallen sidekick in an old cafe
never slept with a dream before he had to go away
there's a bell in the tower 
Uncle Ray bought a round
don't worry bout the army 
in the cold cold ground
cold cold ground
now don't be a cry baby 
when there's wood in the shed
there's a bird in the chimney 
and a stone in my bed
when the road's washed out 
they pass the bottle around
and wait in the arms 
of the cold cold ground
cold cold ground
there's a ribbon in the willow 
and a tire swing rope
and a briar patch of berries 
takin over the slope
the cat'll sleep in the mailbox 
and we'll never go to town
til we bury every dream in 
the cold cold ground
cold cold ground
give me a Winchester rifle and a whole box of shells
Blow the roof off the goat barn 
let it roll down the hill
the piano is firewood 
times square is a dream
I find we'll lay down together in the cold cold ground
cold cold ground
cold cold ground
call the cops on the Breedloves 
bring a Bible and a rope
and a whole box of rebel
and a bar of soap
make a pile of trunk tires 
and burn 'em all down
bring a dollar with you baby 
in the cold cold ground
cold cold ground
take a weathervane rooster 
throw rocks at his head
stop talking to the neighbors 
till we all go dead
beware of my temper 
and the dog that I've found
break all the windows in the 
cold cold ground
cold cold ground

# Cold Water

Well I woke up this morning
With the cold water
With the cold water
With the cold water
Woke up this morning
With the cold water
With the cold water
With the cold
Police at the station
and they don't look friendly
Well they don't look friendly
Well they don't look friendly
Police at the station
and they don't look friendly
They don't look friendly well
they don't
Blind or crippled
Sharp or dull
I'm reading the Bible
by a 40 watt bulb
What price freedom
Dirt is my rug
Well I leep like a baby
with the snakes and the bugs
Well the stores are open
but I ain't got no $
I ain't got no $
Stores are open but I
ain't got no $
ain't got no $
Well I ain't
Found an old dog
and he seems to like me
seems to like me
well he seems to like me
Found an old dog and he
seems to like me
seems to like me
well he seems
Seen them fellows
with the card board signs
scrapin up a little $
to buy a bottle of wine
Pregnant women and
the Vietnam vets I say
beggin on the freeway
Bout as hard as it gets
Well I slept in the graveyard
it was cool and still
cool and still
it was cool and still
Slept in the graveyard
it was cool and still
cool and still and it
was cool
Slept all night in the Cedar grove
I was born to ramble
born to rove
Some men are searchin for the
Holy Grail
but there ain't nothin sweeter
than ridin the rails
I look 47 but I'm 24
Well they shooed me away
from here the time before 
Turned there their backs
and they locked their doors
I'm watchin T.V. in
the window of a furniture store
Well I woke up this morning
with the cold water
with the cold water
with the cold water
Woke up this morning
with the cold water

# Come On Up To The House

Well the moon is broken
And the sky is cracked
Come on up to the house
The only things that you can see
Is all that you lack
Come on up to the house
All your cryin don't do no good
Come on up to the house
Come down off the cross
We can use the wood
Come on up to the house
Come on up to the house
Come on up to the house
The world is not my home
I'm just a passin thru
Come on up to the house
There's no light in the tunnel
No irons in the fire
Come on up to the house
And your singin lead soprano
In a junkman's choir
You gotta come on up to the house
Does life seem nasty, brutish and short
Come on up to the house
The seas are stormy 
And you can't find no port
Come on up to the house
There's nothin in the world
That you can do
You gotta come on up to the house
And you been whipped by the forces
That are inside you
Come on up to the house
Well you're high on top
Of your mountain of woe
Come on up to the house
Well you know you should surrender
But you can't let go
You gotta come on up to the house

# Coney Island Baby

Every night she comes
To take me out to dreamland
When I'm with her, I'm the richest
Man in the town
She's a rose, she's the pearl
She's the spin on my world
All the stars make their wishes on her eyes
She's my Coney Island Baby
She's my Coney Island Girl
She's a princess, in a red dress
She's the moon in the mist to me
She's my Coney Island Baby
She's my Coney Island Girl

# Crossroads

Now, George was a good straight boy to begin with,
but there was bad blood in him someway
he got into the magic bullets and 
that leads straight to Devil's work
just like marywanna leads to heroin
You think you can take them bullets and leave 'em, do you?
Just save a few for your bad days. 
well...
Well, now we all have those bad days when we can't hit for shit.
The more of them magics you use, 
the more bad days you have without them
So it comes down to finally
all your days being bad without the bullets
It's magics or nothing.
Time to stop chippying around and kidding yourself,
kid, you're hooked, heavy as lead
And that's where old George found himself.
Out there at the crossroads.
molding the Devil's bullets.
Now a man figures it's his bullets, 
so it'll hit what he wants to hit. 
But it don't always work out that way
You see, some bullets is special for a single aim.
A certain stag, or a certain person
And no matter where you aim, that's where the bullet will end up.
And in the moment of aiming, the gun turns into a dowser's wand,
and point where the bullet wants to go
(George Schmid was moving in a series of convulsive spasms
like someone in an epileptic fit
with his face distorted, and his eyes wild, like a lassoed horse
bracing his legs but something kept pulling him on.
And now he is picking up the skulls and making the circle.)
I guess old George didn't rightly know what he was getting himself into,
the fit was on him and it carried him right to the crossroads.

# Danny Says

Danny says we gotta go
gotta go to Idaho
but we can't go surfing 
cause it's 20 below
sound check is at 5:02
record stores and interviews
I can't wait to be with you tomorrow
baby oh ho oh ho 
we got nowhere to go
and it may sound funny
but it's true
hanging out in 100 b
watching get smart on TV
thinking about you and me and you and me
hanging out in L.A. and there's nowhere to go
it ain't Christmas if there ain't no snow
listening to Sheena on the radio
Oh ho oh ho
sound check is at 5:02
record stores and interviews
I can't wait to be with you tomorrow

# Day After Tomorrow

I got your letter today
And I miss you all so much here
I can't wait to see you all
And I'm counting the days dear
I still believe that there's gold
At the end of the world and I'll
Come home to Illinois on the
Day after tomorrow
Its so hard and its cold here
And I'm tired of taking orders
And I miss old Rockford town
Up by the Wisconsin border
What I miss you won't believe
Shoveling snow and raking leaves
And my plane will touch down
On the day after tomorrow
I close my eyes every nite
And I dream that I can hold you
They fill us full of lies, everyone buys
Bout what it means to
Be a soldier, I still don't
Know how I'm supposed to feel bout
All the blood that's been spilled
Will God on this throne
Get me back home
On the day after tomorrow
You can't deny, the other side
Don't want to die anymore
Then we do, what I'm
Trying to say is don't they pray
To the same God that we do?
And Tell me how does God
Choose, who's prayers does he
Refuse? who turns the wheel
Who rolls the dice, on the
Day after tomorrow
I'm not fighting for justice
I am not fighting for freedom
I am fighting for my life and
Another day in the world here
I just do what I've been told
We're just the gravel on the road
And only the lucky ones come
Home, on the day after tomorrow
And the summer it too
Will fade and with it
Brings the winter's frost dear
And I know we too are made
Of all the things that we have
Lost here, I'll be 21 today
I been saving all my pay
And my plane will touch down
On the day after tomorrow

# Dead And Lovely

She was a middle class girl
In over her head
She thought she could
Stand up in the deep end
He had a bullet proof smile
He had money to burn
She thought she had the moon
In her pocket...
But now she's dead
She's so dead forever
Dead and lovely now
I've always been told to
Remember this
Don't let a fool kiss you
Never marry for love
He was hard to impress
He knew everyone's secrets
He wore her on his arm
Just like jewelry
He never gave but he got
He kept her on a leash
He's not the kind of wheel
You fall asleep at
But now she's dead
She's so dead
Forever dead and
Lovely now
Come closer look deep
You've fallen fast
Just like a plane on a 
Stormy sea
She made up someone to be
She made up somewhere to
Be from
This is one business in the
World where that's no
Problem at all
Every thing that is left
They will only plow under
Soon every one you know
Will be gone
But now she's dead
She's so dead
Forever dead and
Lovely now
I've always been told to 
Remember this
Don't let a kiss fool you
Never marry for love
Now they're all watching
The sea
What's lost can never be broken
Her roots were sweet
But they were shallow
But now she's dead
She's so dead
Forever dead and
Lovely now

# Depot, Depot

Depot, depot, what am I doing here?
Depot, depot, what am I doing here?
I ain't coming, I ain't going
My confusion is showing
And outside the midnight wind is blowing, Sixth Avenue
I'm gonna paint myself blue
At the depot
I watch the taxis pull up and idle
I can't claim title to a single memory
You offered me a key
'Cause opportunity don't knock
Has no tongue as you cannot talk
You're gonna shuffle when you walk
At the depot
This peeping Tom needs a peephole
And an up-tempo song
To move me along
When I find this depot, baby
I'm on a roll just like a pool ball, baby
I'm gonna be there at the roll call maybe
At the depot
Outside the midnight wind is blowing Sixth Avenue
Ah, tell me what is a poor boy to do?
At the depot
I'm on a roll just like a pool ball, baby
I'm gonna be there at the roll call maybe
At the depot
Depot

# Diamonds & Gold

The broken glass 
And the rusty nails 
Where the violets grow
Say goodbye to the railroad
And the mad dogs of summer
And everything that I know
What some men will do here for diamonds
What some men will do here for gold
They're wounded but they just keep on climbin
And they sleep by the side of the road
There's a hole in the ladder 
A fence we can climb
Mad as a hatter
You're thin as a dime
Go out to the meadow 
The hills are agreen
Sing me a rainbow 
Steal me a dream
Small time Napoleons 
Shattered his knees
But he stays in the saddle for Rose
And all his disciples
They shave in the gutter
And gather what's left of his clothes
What some men will do here for diamonds
What some men will do here for gold
They're wounded but they just keep on climbin
And they sleep by the side of the road
There's a hole in the ladder 
A fence we can climb
Mad as a hatter
You're thin as a dime
Go out to the meadow 
The hills are agreen
Sing me a rainbow 
Steal me a dream

# Diamonds on My Windshield

Well, these diamonds on my windshield
And these tears from heaven
Well, I'm pulling into town on the Interstate
I got a steel train in the rain
And the wind bites my cheek through the wing
And it's these late nights and this freeway flying
It always makes me sing
There's a Duster trying to change my tune
He's pulling up fast on the right
Rolling restlessly by a twenty-four hour moon
And a Wisconsin hiker with a cue-ball head
He's wishing he was home in a Wisconsin bed
But there's fifteen feet of snow in the east
Colder than a welldigger's ass
And it's colder than a welldigger's ass
Oceanside, it ends the ride with San Clemente coming up
Those Sunday desperados slip by and cruise with a dry back
And the orange drive-in, the neon billing
And the theatre's filling to the brim
With slave girls and a hot spurn bucket full of sin
Metropolitan area with interchange and connections
Fly-by-nights from Riverside
And out of state plates running a little late
But the sailors jockey for the fast lane
So 101 don't miss it
There's rolling hills and concrete fields
And the broken line's on your mind
The eights go east and the fives go north
And the merging nexus back and forth
You see your sign, cross the line, signaling with a blink
And the radio's gone off the air
Gives you time to think
And you hear the rumble
As you fumble for a cigarette
And blazing through this midnight jungle
Remember someone that you met
And one more block, the engine talks
Whispers 'home at last'
It whispers 'home at last'
Whispers 'home at last'
Whispers 'home at last'
Whispers 'home at last'
And the diamonds on my windshield
And these tears from heaven
Well I'm pulling into town on the Interstate
I got me a steel train in the rain
And the wind bites my cheek through the wing
Late nights and freeway flying
Always makes me sing
It always makes me sing
Hey, look here, Jack
Okay

# Dirt In The Ground

What does it matter, a dream of love 
Or a dream of lies
We're all gonna be the same place 
When we die
Your spirit don't leave knowing 
Your face or your name
And the wind through your bones 
Is all that remains
And we're all gonna be
Just dirt on the ground
The quill from a buzzard 
The blood writes the word
I want to know am I the sky 
Or a bird
'Cause hell is boiling over 
And heaven is full
We're chained to the world 
And we all gotta pull
And we're all gonna be
...just dirt in the ground
Now the killer was smiling 
With nerves made of stone
He climbed the stairs 
And the gallows groaned
And the people's hearts were pounding 
They were throbbing, they were red
As he swung out over the crowd
I heard the hangman said
We're all gonna be...
Just dirt in the ground
Now Cain slew Abel 
He killed him with a stone
The sky cracked open 
And the thunder groaned
Along a river of flesh
Can these dry bones live?
Ask a king or a beggar
And the answer they'll give
Is we're all gonna be
Yea yea
We're all gonna be just

# Dog Door

Well she's as mean as a needle
don't get too close to the heater
she's like a mean shop keeper
who got an extra gun
she about 6'4" and she's a wrecking ball
now go ahead and kiss her
she brought the bad weather with her
she got you coming through the dog door
she got you coming through the dog door
now pigs get fat hogs get slaughtered
you ought to walk away
well you can't but you ought to
climb the rickety stairs
she got the long black hair
but don't sit there
electricity chair
she got you coming through the dog door
she got you coming through the dog door
pitchfork
crowbar
claw hammer
hot tar
she's got ruin in her name 
but she can make it rain
she's a small town jail
and you're starving in the belly of a whale
she got you coming through the dog door
She got you coming through the dog door
pitchfork
crowbar
claw hammer
hot tar

# Don't Go Into That Barn

Don't go into that barn, yea
Don't go into that barn, yea
Black cellophane sky at midnite
Big blue moon with three gold rings
I called Champion to the window
And I pointed up above the trees
That's when I heard my name in a scream
Coming from the woods, out there
I let my dog run off the chain
I locked my door real good with a chair
Don't go into that barn, yea
Don't go into that barn, yea
Everett Lee broke loose again
Its worse than the time before
Cause he's high on potato and tulip wine
Fermented in the muddy rain of course
A drunken wail a drunken train
Blew through the birdless trees
Oh, you're alone alright
Your alone alright
How did I know
How did I know
Don't go into that barn, yea
Don't go into that barn, yea
An old black tree
Scratching up the sky with boney, claw like fingers
A rusty black rake
Digging up the turnips
Of a muddy cold grey sky
Shiny tooth talons
Coiled for grabbing a stranger happening by
And the day went home early
And the sun sank down into 
The muck of a deep dead sky
Don't go into that barn, yea
Don't go into that barn, yea
Back since Saginaw Calinda was born
It's been cotton, soybeans, tobacco and corn
Behind the porticoed house of a long dead farm
They found the falling down timbers of a spooky old barn
Out there like a slave ship upside down
Wrecked beneath the waves of grain
When the river is low
They find old bones and 
When they plow they always
Dig up chains
Don't go into that barn, yea
Don't go into that barn, yea
Did you bury your fire?
Yes sir
Did you cover your tracks?
Yes sir
Did you bring your knife?
Yes sir
Did they see your face? 
No sir
Did the Mom see you?
No sir
Did you go cross the river?
Yes sir
Did you fix your rake?
Yes sir
Did you stay down wind?
Yes sir
Did you hide your gun?
Yes sir
Did you smuggle your rum?
Yes sir
How did I know
How did I know
How did I know
Don't go into that barn, yea
Don't go into that barn, yea
Don't forget that I warned you
Don't go into that barn, yea
Don't go into that barn, yea
Don't go into that barn, yea
No shirt no coat
Put me on a flat boat
Dover, down to Covington
Covington to Louisville
Louisville to Henderson
Henderson to Smithland
Smithland to Memphis
Down to Vicksburg to
Natchez put me on a
Flat boat Dover Dam
To Covington, Covington to
Louisville, Louisville to 
Henderson...

# Down There By The Train

There's a place I know 
where the train goes slow
where the sinners can be washed 
in the blood of the lamb
there's a river by the trestle 
down by Sinner's Grove
down where the Willow and the Dogwood grows
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there where the train
goes slow
you can hear the whistle
you can hear the bell
from the halls of heaven 
to the gates of hell
there's room for the foresaken 
if you're there on time
you'll be washed of all your sins 
and all of your crimes
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there where the train
goes slow
there's a golden moon 
that shines up through the mist
I know that your name 
will be on that list
There's no eye for an eye 
there's no tooth for a tooth
I saw Judas Iscariot carrying John Wilkes Booth
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there where the train
goes slow
so if you live in darkness
if you live in shame
all of the passengers 
will be treated the same
old Humpty Jackson and Gyp the Blood will sing
Charlie Whitman is on the Dillinger's wings
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there where the train
goes slow
if you've lost all your hope 
if you've lost all your faith
I know you will be cared for 
I know you will be safe
all the shameful and all of the whores
even the soldier who pierced the heart of the lord
is down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there where the train
goes slow
well I've never asked forgiveness and 
I've never said a prayer
I've never given of myself 
I've never truly cared
I've hurt the ones who loved me 
I'm still raising cain
I've taken the low road and 
if you've done the same
meet me down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there where the train
goes slow

# Down, Down, Down

He went down down down
and the devil called him by name
he went down down down
hangin' onto the back of a train
he went down down down
this boy went solid down
always chewed tobacco 
and the bathtub gin
always chewed tobacco 
and the bathtub gin
he went down down down
this boy went solid down
he went down

# Downtown

Red Pants and the Sugarman in the Temple Street gloom
drinkin chivas regal in a four dollar room
just another dead soldier in a powder blue light
Sugarman says baby everythings alright
goin downtown down downtown

Montclaire de Havelin doin the St. Vitus dance

all the traffic in the street but it's so hard to think
goin downtown down downtown
goin down downtown
Frankie's wearin lipstick le cardin

Sally's high on crank and hungry for some sweets
fem in the sheets but she's butch in the streets

I want to hold you in my arms I want to push you around
I wanna break your bottle and spill out all your charms

Red Pants and the Sugarman in the Temple Street gloom

Red Pants says to Sugarman said everything's alright

# Downtown Train

Outside another yellow moon
Punched a hole in the nighttime, yes 
I climb through the window and down the street
Shining like a new dime
The downtown trains are full 
With all those Brooklyn girls
They try so hard to break out of their little worlds
You wave your hand and they scatter like crows
They have nothing that will ever capture your heart
They're just thorns without the rose
Be careful of them in the dark
Oh if I was the one
You chose to be your only one
Oh baby can't you hear me now
Will I see you tonight
On a downtown train
Every night its just the same
You leave me lonely, now
I know your window and I know it's late
I know your stairs and your doorway
I walk down your street and past your gate
I stand by the light at the four way
You watch them as they fall
They all have heart attacks
They stay at the carnival 
But they'll never win you back
Will I see you tonight
On a downtown train
Where Every night its just the same
You leave me lonely
Will I see you tonight
On a downtown train
All of my dreams just fall like rain
All upon on a downtown train

# Drunk On The Moon

Tight-slack clad girls on the graveyard shift
'Neath the cement stroll, catch the midnight drift
Cigar chewing Charlie in that newspaper nest
Grifting hot horse tips on who's running the best
And I'm blinded by the neon
Don't try and change my tune
Cause I thought I heard a saxophone
I'm drunk on the moon
And the moon's a silver slipper, it's pouring champagne stars
And Broadway's(8) like a serpent pulling shiny top-down cars
Laramer is teeming with that undulating beat
And some Bonneville is screaming, it's way wilder down the street
And I'm blinded by the neon
Don't try and change my tune
I thought I heard a saxophone
I'm drunk on the moon
Hearts flutter and race, the moon's on the wane
Tarts mutter their dream hopes the night will ordain
Come schemers and dancers, cherry delight
As a Cleveland-bound Greyhound, and it cuts through the night
And I've hawked all my yesterdays
Don't try and change my tune
Cause I thought I heard a saxophone
I'm drunk on the moon

# Earth Died Screaming

Rudy's on the midway 
And Jacob's in the hole
The monkey's on the ladder 
The devil shovels coal
With crows as big as airplanes 
The lion has three heads
And someone will eat the skin that he sheds
And the earth died screaming
While I lay dreaming of you
Well, hell doesn't want you 
And heaven is full
Bring me some water 
Put it in this skull
I walk between the raindrops 
Wait in bug house square
And the army ants
They leave nothin' but the bones
And the earth died screaming
While I lay dreaming of you
There was thunder 
There was lightning
Then the stars went out
And the moon fell from the sky
It rained mackerel
It rained trout
And the great day of wrath has come
And here's mud in your big red eye
The poker's in the fire 
And the locusts take the sky
And the earth died screaming
While I lay dreaming of you

# Eggs And Sausage (In A Cadillac With Susan Michelson)

Nighthawks at the diner of Emma's Forty-Niner
There's a rendezvous of strangers around the coffee urn tonight
All the gypsy hacks and the insomniacs
Now the paper's been read, now the waitress said
'Eggs and sausage and a side of toast
Coffee and a roll, hash browns over easy
Chile in a bowl with burgers and fries
What kind of pie? Yeah...'
It's a graveyard charade, it's a late shift masquerade
And it's two for a quarter, dime for a dance
Woolworth's rhinestone diamond earrings and a sideways glance
Now the register rings, now the waitress sings
Eggs and sausage and a side of toast
Coffee and a roll, hash browns over easy
Chile in a bowl with burgers and fries
What kind of pie? Yeah
Now well, the classified section offers no direction
It's a cold caffeine in a nicotine cloud
Now the touch of your fingers lingers burning in my memory
I've been eighty-sixed from your scheme
Now I'm in a melodramatic nocturnal scene
Now I'm a refugee from a disconcerted affair
Now the lead pipe morning falls, now the waitress calls
'Eggs and sausage, another side of toast
Coffee and a roll, hash browns over easy
Chile in a bowl with burgers and fries
Now what kind of pie?'
À la mode if you will
Just come in and join the crowd
Had some time to kill, yeah
You see, I just come in to join the crowd
Had some time to kill
Just come in to join the crowd
Cause I had some time to kill

# Emotional Weather Report

What we're talking about is late night and early morning low clouds
With a chance of fog, chance of showers into the afternoon
With variable high cloudiness and gusty winds
Gusty winds at times around the corner of Sunset and Alvarado
Yeah, I know, things are tough all over
When the thunder storms start increasing over the
Southeast and south central portions of my apartment, I get upset
And a line of thunderstorms was developing in the early morning hours
Ahead of a slow moving cold front, cold-blooded
With tornado watches issued shortly before noon Sunday
For the areas including the western region of my mental health
And the northern portion of my ability to deal rationally
With my disconcerted precarious emotional situation
It's cold out there
Colder than the ticket taker's smile at the Ivar Theatre, on Saturday night
Flash flood watches cover the southern portion of my disposition, yeah
There was no severe weather well into the afternoon
Except for kind of a lone gust of wind in the bedroom
A high pressure zone covering the eastern portion of a small
Suburban community with a 1034 millibar high pressure zone
And a weak pressure ridge extending from my eyes down to my cheeks
'Cause since you left me baby and put the vice grips on my mental health
Well, the extended outlook for an indefinite period of time
Until you come back to me, baby, is high tonight, low tomorrow
And precipitation is expected
That wraps up the weather for this evening.
Now back to the eleven o'clock blues.
Doctor George Fishbeck ain't got nothing on me!

# Everything Goes to Hell

Why be sweet, why be careful, why be kind?
A man has only one thing on his mind
Why ask politely, why go lightly, why say please?
They only want to get you on your knees
There are a few things I never could believe
A woman when she weeps
A merchant when he swears
A thief who says he'll pay
A lawyer when he cares
A snake when he is sleeping
A drunkard when he prays
I don't believe you go to heaven when you're good
Everything goes to hell, anyway...
Laissez-faire mi amour, ce la vie
Shall I return to shore or swim back out to sea?
The world don't care what a soldier does in town
It's all hanging in the windows by the pound
There are few things I never could believe...
A woman when she weeps
A merchant when he swears
A thief who says he'll pay
A lawyer when he cares
A snake when he is sleeping
A drunkard when he prays
I don't believe you go to heaven when you're good
Everything goes to hell, anyway...
I only want to hear your purr and to hear you moan
There is another man who brings the money home
I don't want dishes in the sink
Please don't tell me what you feel or 
what you think
There are few things I never could believe...

# Everything You Can Think

Everything you can think of is true
Before the ocean was blue
We were lost in a flood
Run red with you blood
Nigerian skeleton crew
Everything you can think of is true
The dish ran away with a spoon
Dig deep in your heart for that little red glow
We're decomposing as we go
Everything you can think of is true
And fishes make wishes on you
We're fighting our way up dreamland's spine
With red flamingos and expensive wine
Everything you can think of is true
The baby's asleep in your shoe
Your teeth are buildings with yellow doors
Your eyes are fish on a creamy shore

# Eyeball Kid

Well Zenora Bariella and Coriander Pyle they had sixteen children in the usual style
They had a curio museum and they had no guile
All they ever wanted was a show biz child
So on the 7th of Dec 1949 they got whatthey'd been wishing for all of the time
He grew up in a trailer by the time he was 9 he rolled off to join  the circus telling fortunes on the side
Hail Hail, the Eyeball kid
Well the 1st time I saw him was a Saigon jail 
Cost me 27 dollars just to go his bail
I said your name will be in lights and that's no doubt
But you got to have a manager that's what it's all about
People would point
People would stare
I'll always be here to protect you and to cut down on the glare
I know you can't speak
I know you can't sign
So cry right here on the dotted line
Hail Hail, the Eyeball kid
Well he was born with out a body
Not even a brow
I made the kid a promise
I made the kid a vow
He's not conventionally handsome
He'll never be tall
He said "all you got to do is book me into Carnegie Hall"
Hail Hail, the Eyeball kid
He's just a little bitty thing
He's just a little guy but women go crazy for the big blue eye
They say how does he dream? How does he think
When he can't ever speak and he can't ever blink?
I said Hail Hail, the Eyeball kid
Hail Hail, the Eyeball kid
Give it up and throw me down a couple of quid
Everybody wants to see the Eyeball kid
How does he dream 
How does he think 
When he can't even speak and he can't even blink
We are all lost in the wilderness we're as blind as can be
He came down to teach us how to really see
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
So give it up and throw me down a couple of quid
Everybody wants to see the Eyeball kid
Eyeball kid
Eyeball kid

# Face To The Highway

I’m going away
I’m going away

The cradle wants a baby
Kitchen wants a pan
The heart wants a certain kind of lover if it can

Ocean wants a sailor
Gun wants a hand
money wants a spender
And the road wants a man

I turned my face to the highway
And I turn my back on you

Devil wants a sinner
Sky wants a bird
Table wants the dinner
Lips want a word

Glass wants the wine
Fist wants to hurt
Clock wants the time
And the shovel wants to work

I turned my face to the highway
And I turn my back on you

I’m going away
I’m going away

Coal wants a miner
Soldier takes a stand
The walls of the prison
Want a solitary man
The window wants a curtain
The plow wants the land
Diamond ring wants to
Fit upon the finger
Of her hand

I turned my face to the highway
And I turned my back on you

I’m going away
I’m going away
I’m going away

# The Fall Of Troy

It's the same with men as with horses and dogs
nothing wants to die
Evelyn James they killed in a game
with guns too big for their hands
just off St. Charles in no man's land
you'll have to find your own way home boys
you'll have to find your own way home

the oldest was Troy 
an eighteen year old boy
shot dead in March in a robbery
his brother started out to hell and to ruin
Troy's killer was never caught they say
young Nick he just went bad that day
now he'll have to find his own way home boys
he'll have to find his own way home

why cook dinner
why make my bed
why come home at all
out the door and through the woods
there's a world where nothing grows

it's hard to say grace and to sit in the place
of someone missing at the table
mom's hair sprayed tight and her face in her hands
watching TV for answers to me
after all she's only human
she's trying to find her own way home boys
she's trying to find her own way home

my legs ache
my heart is sore
the well is full of pennies

# Falling Down

I've come 500 miles 
Just to see your halo
Come from St. Petersburg 
Scarlett and me
When I open my eyes 
I was blind as can be
And to give a man luck 
He must fall in the sea
And she wants you to steal and get caught
For she loves you for all that you are not
When you're falling down
Falling down
When you're falling down
Falling down falling down

You forget all the roses 
Don't come around on Sunday
She's not gonna choose you 
For standing so tall
Go on take a swig of that poison 
And like it
And now don't ask for silverware 
Don't ask for nothing
Go on and put your ear to the ground
You know you'll be hearing that sound 
Falling down
You're falling down falling down
Falling down falling down
Falling down

When you're falling down 
Falling down falling down

Go on down see that wrecking ball 
Come swing in on her now
Everyone knew that hotel was a goner
They broke all the windows 
And took all the door knobs
And they hauled it away 
In a couple of days
Now someone yelled timber
Take off your hat
We all look smaller 
Down here on the ground
When you're falling down 
Falling down falling down
Falling down falling down
Falling down

Someone's falling down 
Falling down falling down
Falling down falling down
Falling down

# Fannin Street
There's a crooked street in Houston town
it's a well worn path I've followed down
now there's ruin in my name 
I wish I never got off the train
I wished I'd listened to the words you said

don't go down to Fannin Street
don't go down to Fannin Street
don't go down to Fannin Street
oh yeah
you'll be lost and never found
you can never turn around

don't go down to Fannin Street

once I held you in my arms I was sure
till I took that silent step through the gilded door
but the desire to have much more all the glitter and the roar
now I know that this is where the sidewalk ends

don't go down to Fannin Street
don't go down to Fannin Street
don't go down to Fannin Street
you'll be lost and never found
you can never turn around

don't go down to Fannin Street

when I was young I thought only of getting out
I said good-bye to my street 
good-bye to my house
give a man gin give a man cards 
give an inch he takes a yard
and I rue the day that I stepped off this train

don't go down to Fannin Street
don't go down to Fannin Street
don't go down to Fannin Street
oh yeah
you'll be lost and never found
you can never turn around

# Filipino Box Spring Hog

Well I hung on to Mary's stump
I danced with a soldier's glee
With a rum soaked crook
And a big fat laugh
I spent my last dollar on thee
I saw Bill Bones, gave him a yell
Kehoe spiked the nog
With a chain link fence
And a scrap iron jaw
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring hog
Spider rolled in from
Hollister Burn
With a one-eyed stolen Mare
Donned himself with chicken fat
Sawin on a jaw bone violin there
Kathleen was sittin down
In little reds recovery room
In her criminal underwear bra
I was naked to the waist
With my fierce black hound
And I'm cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog

Dig a big pit in a dirt alley road
Fill it with madrone and bay
Stinks like hell
And the neighbors complain
Don't give a hoot what they say
Slap that hog
Gotta roll em over twice
Baste him with a sweeping broom
You gotta swat them flies
And chain up the dogs
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog

Rattle snake piccata with grapes and figs
Old brown Betty with a yellow wig
Tain't the mince meat filagree
And it ain't the turkey neck stew
And it ain't them bruleed
Okra seeds though she
Made them especially for you
Worse won a prize for her
Bottom black pie
The beans got to thrown to the dogs
Jaheseus Christ I can always
Make room when they're
Cookin up a Filipino box Spring Hog
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog
Cookin up a Filipino Box Spring Hog

# First Kiss

She drove a big old Lincoln 
with suicide doors
and a sewing machine in the back
and a light bulb that looked like 
an alligator egg
was mounted up front on the hood

and she had an Easter bonnet that had been signed 
by Tennessee Ernie Ford
and she always had saw dust in her hair
and she cut two holes in the back of her dress
and she had these scapular wings
that were covered with feathers and electrical tape
and when she got good and drunk
she would sing about Elkheart, Indiana
where the wind is strong 
and folks mind their own business

and she had at least a hundred old baseballs 
that she'd taken from kids
and she collected bones of all kinds
and she lived in a trailer under a bridge
and she made her own whiskey and gave cigarettes to kids
and she'd been struck by lightning seven or eight times
and she hated the mention of rain

and she made up her own language
and she wore rubber boots
and she could fix anything with string
and her lips were like cherries
and she was stronger than any man
and she smelled like gasoline and root beer fizz
and she put mud on a bee sting 
I got at the creek
and she gave me 
my very first kiss
and she gave me 
my very first kiss

talking 'bout my little Kathleen
she's just a fine young thing
someday she'll wear my ring
my little Kathleen

# Fish & Bird

They bought a round for the sailor
And they heard his tale
Of a world that was so far away
And a song that we'd never heard
A song of a little bird
That fell in love with a whale

He said: you cannot live in the ocean
And she said to him: You never can live in the sky
But the ocean is filled with tears
And the sea turns into a mirror
And there's a whale in the moon when it's clear
And a bird on the tide

Please don't cry
Let me dry
Your eyes

So tell me that you will wait for me
Hold me in your arms
I promise we never will part
I'll never sail back to the time
But I'll always pretend you're mine
Though I know that we both must part
You can live in my heart

# Fish In The Jailhouse

Peoria Johnson told Dudlow Joe
I can break out of any old jail you know
the bars are iron the walls are stone
all I need me is an old fish bone

they're serving fish in the jailhouse tonight
oh boy
they're serving fish in the jailhouse tonight

corvina opal eye hammerhead shark
steelhead salmon or a mud bank carp
sand me one side dull 
whittle the other side sharp
by Saturday night I'll be in central park

they're serving fish in the jailhouse tonight
oh boy
They're serving fish in the jailhouse tonight

ask Little Son Jackson or the 44. Kid
or Whitfield Faraday what I did
from Yazoo city up to Rollin Fork
from Natchez to Kinosha 
from New Dime to New York

they're serving fish in the jailhouse tonight
oh boy
They're serving fish in the jailhouse tonight

gimme a nice totuava or a chicken of the sea
I'm gonna fashion me a fishbone skeleton key
tell Scullion Childs I won't be late
you can bet your freedom I'm gonna clean my plate

fish in the jailhouse tonight
they're serving fish in the jailhouse tonight
they're serving fish in the jailhouse
fish in the jailhouse tonight
serving fish in the jailhouse tonight
serving fish in the jailhouse tonight
all right

# Flash Pan Hunter

The flash pan hunter sways with the wind
His rifle is the sound of the morning
Each sulfurous bullet way have its own wit
Each cartridge comes with a warning
Beware of elaborate telescopic meats
They will find their way back to the forest

For Wilhelm can't wait 
To be Peg Leg's crown
As the briar is strangling 
The rose back down

His back shall be my slender new branch
It will sway and bend in the breeze
As the Devil does his Polka 
With a hatchet in his hand
As a sniper in the branches of the trees
As the vulture flutters down
As the snake sheds his dove
Wilhelm's cutting off his fingers 
So they'll fit into his glove

For Wilhelm can't wait 
To be Peg Leg's crown
As the briar is strangling 
The rose back down

# Flowers Grave

Someday the silver moon and I
Will go to Dreamland
I will close my eyes
And wake up there in Dreamland
But tell me who will put flowers
On a flower's grave
Who will say a prayer

Will I meet a China rose there
In Dreamland
Or does love lie bleeding
In Dreamland
Are these days gone forever and always

If we are to die tonight
Is there moonlight up ahead
And if we are to die tonight
Another rose will bloom

For a faded rose
Will I be the one that you save
I love when it showers
But no one puts flowers
On a flower's grave

As one rose dies another blooms
It's always been that way
I remember the showers
But no one puts flowers
On a flower's grave

# Foreign Affair

When traveling abroad in the continental style
It's my belief one must attempt to be discreet
And subsequently bear in mind your transient position
Allows you a perspective that's unique

And though you'll find your itinerary a blessing and a curse
Your wanderlust won't let you settle down
And you'll wonder how you ever fathomed that you'd be content
To stay within the city limits of a small mid western town

Most vagabonds I knowed don't ever want to find the culprit
That remains the object of their long relentless quest
The obsession's in the chasing and not the apprehending
The pursuit you see and never the arrest

Without fear of contradiction bon voyage is always hollered
In conjunction with a handkerchief from shore
By a girl who drives a Rambler and furthermore is overly concerned
That she won't see him anymore

Planes and trains and boats and buses characteristically
Evoke a common attitude of blue
Unless you have a suitcase and a ticket and a passport
And the cargo that they're carrying is you

A foreign affair juxtaposed with a stateside
And domestically approved romantic fancy
Is mysteriously attractive due to circumstances
Knowing it will only be parlayed into a memory

# Frank's Wild Years

Well Frank settled down in the Valley
and he hung his wild years 
on a nail that he drove through 
his wife's forehead
he sold used office furniture 
out there on San Fernando Road
and assumed a $30,000 loan 
at 15 _ % and put a down payment 
on a little two bedroom place
his wife was a spent piece of used jet trash
made good bloody marys
kept her mouth shut most of the time
had a little Chihuahua named Carlos
that had some kind of skin disease
and was totally blind. They had a thoroughly modern kitchen
self-cleaning oven (the whole bit)
Frank drove a little sedan
they were so happy

One night Frank was on his way home 
from work, stopped at the liquor store,
picked up a couple Mickey's Big Mouths
drank 'em in the car on his way 
to the Shell station, he got a gallon of 
gas in a can, drove home, doused 
everything in the house, torched it,
parked across the street, laughing
watching it burn, all Halloween 
orange and chimney red then 
Frank put on a top forty station
got on the Hollywood Freeway
headed North

Never could stand that dog

# Franks Theme

Dream away the tears in your eyes
Dream away your sorrows
Dream away all your goodbyes
Dream away tomorrow
I promise when the sun comes up
I promise I'll be true
and just like before the band starts to play
they always play your favorite tune
and dream away when everyone's gone
dream away your grey skies too
dream away and nothing is wrong
dreams have wishes that are waiting for you
and up ahead the road is turning
turning for you and me
and just like before 
the band starts to play
now there's that twinkle in your eye
and dream away

# Fumblin' With The Blues

Friday left me fumbling with the blues
And it's hard to win when you always lose
Because the nightspots spend your spirit
Beat your head against the wall
Two dead ends and you've still got to choose

You know the bartenders they all know my name
And they catch me when I'm pulling up lame
And I'm a pool-shooting-shimmy-shyster shaking my head
When I should be living clean instead

You know the ladies I've been seeing off and on
Well they spend your love and then they're gone
You can't be lovin' someone who is savage and cruel
Take your love and then they leave on out of town, no they do

Well now falling in love is such a breeze
But its standing up that's so hard for me
I wanna squeeze you but I'm scared to death I'd break your back
You know your perfume well it won't let me be

And you know the bartenders all know my name
And they catch me when I'm pulling up lame
And I'm a pool-shooting-shimmy-shyster shaking my head
When I should be living clean instead

Well, come on baby let your love light shine
Gotta bury me inside of your fire
Because your eyes are enough to blind me
You're like a-looking at the sun
You gotta whisper tell me I'm the one
Come on and whisper tell me I'm the one
Gotta whisper tell me I'm the one
Come on and whisper tell me I'm the one

# Georgia Lee

Cold was the night, hard was the ground
They found her in a small grove of trees
Lonesome was the place where Georgia was found. 
She's too young to be out on the street

Why wasn't God watching?
Why wasn't God listening?
Why wasn't God there for 
Georgia Lee?

Ida said she couldn't keep Georgia from dropping out of school
I was doing the best that I could but she kept runnin away from this world these children are so hard to raise good

Why wasn't God watching?
Why wasn't God listening?
Why wasn't God there for 
Georgia Lee?

Close your eyes and count to ten
I will go and hide but then be sure to find me. 
I want you to find me and we'll play all over
We will play all over again.

There's a toad in the witch grass
There's a crow in the corn
Wild flowers on a cross by the road
and somewhere a baby is crying
for her mom
As the hills turn from green back 
to gold

Why wasn't God watching?
Why wasn't God listening?
Why wasn't God there for 
Georgia Lee?

# Get Behind The Mule

Molly be damned smote Jimmy the Harp
With a horrid little pistol and a lariat
she's goin to the bottom
and she's goin down the drain
Said she wasn't big enough to carry it

She got to get behind the Mule
in the morning and plow
She got to get behind the Mule
in the morning and plow
She got to get behind the Mule
in the morning and plow
She got to get behind the Mule
in the morning and plow

Choppity chop goes the axe in the woods
You gotta meet me by the fall down tree
Shovel of dirt upon a coffin lid
and I know they'll come lookin for me boys
and I know they'll come a-lookin for me

Got to get behind the Mule
in the morning and plow
Got to get behind the Mule 
in the morning and plow
Got to get behind the Mule
in the morning and plow
Got to get behind the Mule
in the morning and plow

Big Jack Earl was 8'1'
He stood in the road and he cried
He couldn't make her love him
Couldn't make her stay
but tell the good Lord that he tried
(Chorus)
Dusty trail from Atchison to Placerville
On the wreck of the Weaverville stage
Beaula fired on Beatty for a lemonade
I was stirring my brandy with a nail boys
Stirring my brandy with a nail
(Chorus)
Well the rampaging sons of the widow James
Jack the cutter and the pock marked kid
Had to stand naked at the bottom
Of the cross
And tell the good lord what they did
Tell the good lord what they did
(Chorus)
Punctuated birds on the power line
In a Studebaker with the Birdie Joe Hoaks
I'm diggin all the way to China
With a silver spoon
While the hangman fumbles with the noose, boys
The hangman fumbles with the noose
(Chorus)
Pin your ear to the wisdom post
Pin your eye to the line
Never let the weeds get higher
than the garden
Always keep a sapphire in your mind
Always keep a diamond in your mind
(Chorus)

# Get Lost

I don’t want to feel all cooped up
I feel like I’m on a chain
I got my ride all souped up
We’re never coming back again
Time it don’t mean nothing
Money means even less
Don’t bring nothin baby
You’re better then all the rest
I wanna go get lost
I wanna go get lost
I wanna go get lost

When you wear that real tight sweater
You know I can’t resist
It’s been that way forever baby
Ever since we kissed
Roll down all the windows
Turn up Wolfman Jack
Please, please love me tender
Ain’t nothin wrong with that
Let’s go get lost
I wanna go get lost
I wanna go get lost
I wanna go get lost

Whatever that they told you about me
Well all of it’s true
You’re never gonna be with out me baby
I’m never gonna be without you
Top it off, fill it with high test
Think about it what cha gonna tell your boss?
And get lost
I just wanna get lost
All night long…

# The Ghosts Of Saturday Night (After Hours At Napoleone's Pizza House)

A cab combs the snake, tryin' to rake in that last night's fare
And a solitary sailor, who spends the facts of his life like small change on strangers
Paws his inside peacoat pocket for a welcome twenty-five cents
And the last bent butt from a package of Kents
As he dreams of a waitress with Maxwell House eyes
And marmalade thighs with scrambled yellow hair
Her rhinestone-studded moniker says "Irene"
As she wipes the wisps of dishwater blonde from her eyes

And the Texaco beacon burns on
The steel-belted attendant with a ring and valve special crying
'Fill 'er up and check that oil
You know it could be your distributor and it could be your coil'

The early morning final edition is on the stands
And the town crier is crying there with nickels in his hands
Pigs in a blanket, sixty-nine cents
Eggs, roll 'em over, and a package of Kents
Adam and Eve on a log, you can sink 'em down straight
Hash browns, hash browns, you know I can't be late

And the early dawn cracks out a carpet of diamonds
Across a cash crop car lot, filled with twilight Coupe Devilles
Leaving the town in the keeping
Of the one who is sweeping
Up the ghosts of Saturday night

# Gin Soaked Boy

I got a belly full of you and that Leavenworth stuff now I'm gonna get out 
And I'm gonna get tough you been lying to me 
How could you crawl so low with some gin-soaked boy that you don't know

I come home last night 
full a fifth of Old Crow
You said you goin' to your Ma's 
but where the hell did you go
you went and slipped out nights 
you didn't think that I'd know
with some gin-soaked boy 
that you don't know

Well I would bet you as far 
as Oklahoma by now
the dogs are barking out back 
and you're knittin' your brow
well, I'm on your tail I sussed your M.O.
from some gin-soaked boy 
that you don't know

# God's Away On Business

I'd sell your heart to the junkman baby
For a buck, for a buck
If you're looking for someone to pull you 
out of that ditch
You're out of luck, you're out of luck

The ship is sinking
The ship is sinking
The ship is sinking

There's leak, there's a leak, in the boiler room
The poor, the lame, the blind
Who are the ones that we kept in charge
Killers, thieves, and lawyers

God's Away, God's away
God's away on Business. Business.
God's Away, God's Away
God's Away on Business. Business.

Digging up the dead with a shovel and a pick
It's a job, it's a job
Bloody moon rising with a plague and a flood
Join the mob, join the mob
It's all over, It's all over, It's all over

There's a leak, there's a leak, in the boiler room
The poor, the lame, the blind
Who are the ones that we kept in charge?
Killers, thieves, and lawyers
God's away, God's away, God's away
On Business. Business.
God's away, God's away, God's away
On Business.

Goddamn there's always such a big temptation
To be good, To be good
There's always free cheddar in a mousetrap, baby
It's a deal, it's a deal
God's away, God's away, God's away
On Business. Business.

I narrow my eyes like a coin slot baby,
Let her ring, let her ring

God's Away, God's Away
God's Away on Business.
Business...

# Goin' Out West

Well I'm goin' out west 
Where the wind blows tall
'Cause Tony Franciosa 
Used to date my ma
They got some money out there
They're giving it away
I'm gonna do what I want 
And I'm gonna get paid
Do what I want 
And I'm gonna get paid

Little brown sausages 
Lying in the sand
I ain't no extra baby 
I'm a leading man
Well, my parole officer 
Will be proud of me
With my Olds 88 
And the devil on a leash

I know karate, Voodoo too
I'm gonna make myself available to you
I don't need no make up
I got real scars
I got hair on my chest
I look good without a shirt

Well I don't lose my composure
In a high speed chase
Well my friends think I'm ugly
I got a masculine face
I got some dragstrip courage
I can really drive a bed
I'm gonna change my name to Hannibal
Or maybe just Rex

I know karate, Voodoo too
I'm gonna make myself available to you
I don't need no make up
I got real scars
I got hair on my chest
I look good without a shirt

I'm gonna drive all night
Take some speed
I'm gonna wait for the sun 
To shine down on me
I cut a hole in my roof
The shape of a heart
And I'm goin' out west 
Where they'll appreciate me
Goin' out west 
Goin' out west

# Good Old World (Waltz)

When I was a boy, 
the moon was a pearl
the sun a yellow gold.
But when I was a man, 
the wind blew cold
the hills were upside down
but now that I have gone from here
there's no place I'd rather be
than to float my chances on the tide
Back in the good old world

On October's last, 
I'll fly back home
rolling down winding way
And all I've got's a pocket full
of flowers on my grave
But now summer is gone 
I remember it best
Back in the good old world
I remember when, 
she held my hand
and we walked home alone in the rain
how pretty her mouth, how soft her hair
nothing can be the same
and there's a rose upon her breast
where I long to lay my head
and her hair was so yellow 
and the wine was so red
Back in the good old world

# Goodnight Irene

Irene good night 
Irene Irene good night
good night Irene 
good night Irene
I'll get you 
in my dreams

last Saturday night I got married
me and my wife settled down
now me and my wife are parted
I'm gonna take me a little stroll uptown

Irene good night 
Irene Irene good night
good night Irene 
good night Irene
I'll get you 
in my dreams

sometimes I live in the country
sometimes I live in town
sometimes I take a great notion
to jump in the river and drown

Irene good night 
Irene Irene good night
good night Irene 
good night Irene
I'll get you 
in my dreams

I love Irene god knows I do
I'll love her till the sea runs dry
if she ever loves another
someone'll take morphine and die

Irene good night 
Irene Irene good night
good night Irene 
good night Irene
I'll get you 
in my dreams

stop your rambling 
stop your gambling
stop staying out late at night
go home to your wife and your family
sit down by the fire light

Irene good night 
Irene Irene good night
good night Irene 
good night Irene
I'll get you 
in my dreams

Irene good night 
Irene Irene good night
good night Irene 
good night Irene
I'll get you 
in my dreams

# Grapefruit Moon

One, two, three, four

Grapefruit moon, one star shining
Shining down on me
Heard that tune, and now I'm pining
Honey, can't you see?
'Cause every time I hear that melody
Something breaks inside
And the grapefruit moon, one star shining
Can't turn back the tide

Never had no destinations
Could not get across
You became my inspiration
Oh, but what a cost
And every time I hear that melody
Something breaks inside
And the grapefruit moon, one star shining
Is more than I can hide

Now I'm smoking cigarettes
And I strive for purity
And I slip just like the stars
Into obscurity
And every time I hear that melody
Puts me up a tree
And the grapefruit moon, one star shining
Is all that I can see

# Green Grass

Lay your head where
My heart used to be
Hold the earth above me
Lay down in the green grass
Remember when you loved me

Come closer don't be shy
Stand beneath a rainy sky
The moon is over the rise
Think of me as a train goes by
Clear the thistles and brambles
Whistle didn't he ramble
Now there's a bubble of me
And its floating in thee
Stand in the shade of me
Things are now made of me
The weather vane will say
It smells like rain today
God took the stars and he
Tossed 'em can't tell
The birds from the blossoms
You'll never be free of me
He'll make a tree from me
Don't say good bye to me
Describe the sky to me
And if the sky falls mark
My words – we'll catch mocking birds

Lay your head where
My heart used to be
Hold the earth above me
Lay down in the green grass
Remember when you loved me

# Gun Street Girl

Falling James in the Tahoe mud
Stick around to tell us all the tale
He fell in love with a Gun Street girl and
Now he's dancing in the Birmingham jail
Dancing in the Birmingham jail

Took a 100 dollars off a Slaughterhouse Joe
Bought a bran' new Michigan 20 gauge
Got all liquored up on that roadhouse corn,
Blew a hole in the hood of a yellow corvette
Blew a hole in the hood of a yellow corvette
Bought a second hand Nova from a Cuban Chinese
Dyed his hair in the bathroom of a Texaco
With a pawnshop radio, quarter past 4
Well he left Waukegan at the slammin' of the door
He left Waukegan at the slammin' of the door

I said, John, John he's long gone
Gone to Indiana 
Ain't never coming home
I said John, John he's long gone
Gone to Indiana 
Ain't never coming home

Sitting in a sycamore in St. John's Wood
Soakin' day old bread in kerosene
He was blue as a robin's egg brown as a hog
Stayin' out of circulation till the dogs get tired
Stayin' out of circulation till the dogs get tired

Shadow fixed the toilet with an old trombone
He never got up in the morning on a Saturday
Sittin' by the Erie with a bull whipped dog
Tellin' everyone he saw
They went thatta way
Tellin' everyone he saw
They went thatta way

Now the rain's like gravel on an old tin roof
And the Burlington Northern's pullin' out of the world
With a head full of bourbon and a dream in the straw
And a Gun Street Girl was the cause of it all
A Gun Street girl was the cause of it all

Riding in the shadow by the St. Joe Ridge
He heard the click clack tappin' of a blind man's cane
Pullin' into Baker on a New Year's Eve
With one eye on the pistol and the other on the door
With one eye on the pistol and the other on the door

Miss Charlotte took her satchel down to King Fish Row
And she smuggled in a bran' new pair of alligator shoes
With her fireman's raincoat and her long yellow hair, well
They tied her to a tree with a skinny millionaire
They tied her to a tree with a skinny millionaire

I said, John, John he's long gone
Gone to Indiana 
Ain't never coming home
I said John, John he's long gone
Gone to Indiana 
Ain't never coming home
Bangin' on a table with an old tin cup
Sing I'll never kiss a Gun Street Girl again
I'll never kiss a Gun Street Girl again

I said, John, John he's long gone
Gone to Indiana 
Ain't never coming home
I said John, John he's long gone
Gone to Indiana 
Ain't never coming home

# The Heart Of A Saturday Night

Well, you gassed her up, behind the wheel
With your arm around your sweet one in your Oldsmobile
Barreling down the boulevard
You're looking for the heart of Saturday night

And you got paid on Friday, your pockets are jingling
Then you see the lights and you get all tingling
Cause you're cruising with a six
You're looking for the heart of Saturday night

Then you comb your hair, you shave your face
Trying to wipe out every trace
Of all the other days in the week
You know that this'll be the Saturday you're reaching your peak

Stopping on the red, you're going on the green
Cause tonight will be like nothing you've ever seen
And you're barreling down the boulevard
You're looking for the heart of Saturday night

Tell me, is it the crack of the pool balls, neon buzzing
Telephone's ringing, it's your second cousin
Is it the barmaid that's smiling from the corner of her eye
Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye

Makes it kind of quiver down in the core
Cause you're dreaming of them Saturdays that came before
And now you're stumbling
You're stumbling onto the heart of Saturday night

You gassed her up and you're behind the wheel
With your arm around your sweet one in your Oldsmobile
Barreling down the boulevard
You're looking for the heart of Saturday night

Is it the crack of the pool balls, neon buzzing
Telephone's ringing, it's your second cousin
And the barmaid is smiling from the corner of her eye
Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye

Makes it kind of special down in the core
And you're dreaming of them Saturdays that came before
It's found you stumbling
Stumbling onto the heart of Saturday night

And you're stumbling
Stumbling onto the heart of Saturday night

# Hell Broke Luce

I had a good home but I left
I had a good home but I left, right, left
That big fucking bomb made me deaf, deaf
A Humvee mechanic put his Kevlar on wrong
I guarantee you’ll meet up with a suicide bomb
Hell broke luce
Hell broke luce

Big fucking ditches in the middle of the road
You pay a hundred dollars just for fillin’ in the hole
Listen to the general every goddamn word
How many ways can you polish up a turd
Left, right, left, left, right
Left, right
Hell broke luce
Hell broke luce
Hell broke luce

How is it that the only ones responsible for making this mess
Got their sorry asses stapled to a goddamn desk
Hell broke luce
Hell broke luce
Left, right, left

What did you do before the war?
I was a chef, I was a chef
What was your name?
It was Geoff, Geoff
I lost my buddy and I wept, wept
I come down from the meth
So I slept, slept
I had a good home but I left, left
Pantsed at the wind for a joke
I pranced right in with the dope
Glanced at her shin she said nope
Left, right, left

Nimrod Bodfish have you any wool
Get me another body bag the body bag’s full
My face was scorched, scorched
I miss my home I miss my porch, porch
Left, right, left

Can I go home in March? March
My stanch was a chin full of soap
That rancid dinner with the pope
Left, right, left

Kelly Presutto got his thumbs blown off
Sergio’s developing a real bad cough
Sergio’s developing a real bad cough
Hell broke luce
Hell broke luce
Hell broke luce

Boom went his head away
And boom went Valerie
What the hell was it that the president said?
Give him a beautiful parade instead
Left, right, left

When I was over here I never got to vote
I left my arm in my coat
My mom she died and never wrote
We sat by the fire and ate a goat
Just before he died he had a toke
Now I’m home and I’m blind
And I’m broke
What is next

# Hoist That Rag

Well I learned the trade
From Piggy Knowles and
Sing Sing Tommy Shay Boys
god used me as hammer boys
To beat his weary drum today

Hoist that rag
Hoist that rag

The sun is up the world is flat
Damn good address for a rat
The smell of blood
The drone of flies
You know what to do if
The baby cries

Hoist that rag
Hoist that rag

Well we stick our fingers in
The ground, heave and 
Turn the world around
Smoke is blacking out the sun
At night I pray and clean my gun
The cracked bell rings as
The ghost bird sings and the gods
Go begging here
So just open fire
As you hit the shore
All is fair in love
And war

Hoist that rag
Hoist that rag
Hoist that rag
Hoist that rag

# Hold On

They hung a sign up in our town
"if you live it up, you won't
live it down"
So, she left Monte Rio, son
just like a bullet leaves a gun
With charcoal eyes and Monroe hips
she went and took that California trip
Well, the moon was gold, her
hair like wind
She said don't look back just
come on Jim
(Chorus)
Oh you got to
Hold on, Hold on
You got to hold on
Take my hand, I'm standing right here
You gotta hold on

Well, he gave her a dimestore watch
and a ring made from a spoon
Everyone is looking for someone to blame
but you share my bed, you share my name
Well, go ahead and call the cops
you don't meet nice girls in coffee shops
She said baby, I still love you
Sometimes there's nothin left to do

Oh you got to
Hold on, hold on
You got to hold on
Take my hand, I'm standing right here, you got to
just hold on

Well, God bless your crooked little heart
St. Louis got the best of me
I miss your broken-china voice
How I wish you were still
here with me

Well, you build it up, you wreck it down
you burn your mansion to the ground
When there's nothing left to keep you here, when
you're falling behind in this
big blue world

Oh you got to
Hold on, hold on
You got to hold on
Take my hand, I'm standing right here
You got to hold on

Down by the Riverside motel, 
it's 10 below and falling 
by a 99 cent store she closed her eyes 
and started swaying 
but it's so hard to dance that way 
when it's cold and there's no music
well your old hometown is so far away
but, inside your head there's a record
that's playing, a song called

Hold on, hold on 
You really got to hold on 
Take my hand, I'm standing right here
and just hold on.

# Home I'll Never Be

Well I left New York 
in nineteen forty-nine
to go across the country 
without a dad blamed dime
Montana in the cold cold fall
I found my father in a gambling hall

father father 
where have you been
I've been out in the world 
since I was only ten
father father 
where have you been
I've been out in the world 
since I was only ten

don't worry about me
about to die of pleurisy
cross the Mississippi
cross the Tennessee
cross the Niagara
home I'll never be
home in old Medora
home in ol' Truckee
Apalachicola
home I'll never be

for better or for worse
or thick and thin
I've been married to the little woman
god he loves me 
like I love him
I want you to do 
just the same for him
well the worms eat away
but don't worry
watch the wind

so I left Montana 
on an old freight train
the night my father died 
in the cold cold rain

rode to Opelousas 
rode to Wounded Knee
rode to Ogallala
home I'll never be
rode to Oklahoma 
rode to El Cajon
rode to old Tehatchapi
rode to San Antone

hey hey

rode to Opelousas 
rode to Wounded Knee
rode to Ogallala
home I'll never be
rode to Oklahoma 
rode to El Cajon
rode to old Tehatchapi
rode to San Antone

home I'll never be

# House Where Nobody Lives

There's a house on my block
that's abandoned and cold
Folks moved out of it a
long time ago
and they took all their things
and they never came back
Looks like it's haunted
with the windows all cracked 
and everyone calls it
the house, the house where
nobody lives.

Once it held laughter
Once it held dreams
Did they throw it away
Did they know what it means
Did someone's heart break
or did someone do somebody wrong?

Well the paint was all cracked
It was peeled off of the wood
Papers were stacked on the porch
where I stood
and the weeds had grown up
just as high as the door
There were birds in the chimney
and an old chest of drawers
Looks like no one will ever
come back to the
House where nobody lives

Once it held laughter
Once it held dreams
Did they throw it away
Did they know what it means
Did someone's heart break
or did someone do somebody wrong?
So if you find someone
someone to have, someone to hold
Don't trade it for silver
Don't trade it for gold
I have all of life's treasures
and they are fine and they are good
They remind me that houses
Are just made of wood
What makes a house grand
Ain't the roof or the doors
If there's love in a house
It's a palace for sure
Without love
It ain't nothin but a house
A house where nobody lives
Without love it ain't nothin
But a house, A house where
Nobody lives.

# How's It Gonna End

He had 3 whole dollars, a worn out car and a wife who was leaving for good
Life's made of trouble worry pain and struggle
She wrote good bye in the dust on the hood 
They found a map of Missouri
Lipstick on the glass
They must of left in the middle of the nite

And I want to know
The same thing
Everyone wants to know
How it going to end?

Behind a smoke colored curtain, the girl disappeared, they found out te ring was a fake
A tree born crooked will never grow straight
She sunk like a hammer into the lake
A long lost letter and old leaky boat
Promises are never meant to keep

And I want to know
The same thing
Everyone wants to know
How it going to end?

The barn leaned over 
The vultures dried their wings
The moon climbed up an empty sky
The sun sank down behind the tree on the hill
There's a killer and he's coming thru the rye
But maybe he's the Father of that lost little girl
It's hard to tell in this light

And I want to know
The same thing
Everyone wants to know
How it going to end?
Drag your wagon and your plow over the bones of the dead
Out among the roses and the weeds
You can never go back
And the answer is no
And wishing for it only
Makes it bleed

Joel Tornabene was broken on the wheel
Shane and Bum Mahoney on the lamb
The grain was as gold as Sheila's hair
All the way from Liverpool with all we could steal
He was robbed of twenty dollars
His body found stripped
Cast into the harbour there and drowned

And I want to know
The same thing
Everyone wants to know
How it going to end?

The sirens are snaking their way up the hill
It's last call somewhere in the world
The reptiles blend in with the color of the street
Life is sweet at the edge of a razor
And down in the front row of an old picture show
The old man is asleep as the credits start to roll

And I want to know the same thing
Everyone wants to know how's it going to end?

# I Beg Your Pardon

I'm just a scarecrow without you
baby please don't disappear
I beg your pardon dear

I got a bottle for a trumpet
and a hatbox for a drum
I beg your pardon dear

I got upset 
I lost my head
I didn't mean the things I said
you are the landscape of my dreams
darling I beg your pardon

I'd give you Boardwalk and Park Place
and all of my hotels
I beg your pardon dear

please don't go back to St. Louis
can't you tell that I'm sincere
I beg your pardon dear

I got upset 
I lost my head
I didn't mean the things I said
you are the landscape of my dreams
darling I beg your pardon

# I Can't Wait To Get Off Work

Well I don't mind working 
cause I used to be jerking off
Most of my time in the the bars
I been a cabby and a stock clerk 
and a soda fountain jock jerk
and a manic mechanic on cars
it's nice work if you can get it 
now who the hell said it
I got money to spend on my girl
but the work never stops 
and I'll be busting my chops
Working for Joe & Sal

and I can't wait to get off work 
and see my baby
she said she'd leave the porch lite 
on for me
I'm disheveled I'm disdainful
I'm distracted and it's painful
but this job sweeping up here is 
gainfully employing me tonight

Tom do this Tom do that 
Tom don't do that
count the cash clean the oven 
dump the trash oh your lovin 
is a rare and a copasetic gift
I'm a moonlight watchmanic
it's hard to be romantic
(sweeping up over by the 
cigarette machine
sweeping up over by the cigarette machine)

and can't wait to get off work 
and see my baby
she'll be waiting up with a magazine for me
clean the bathrooms, clean um good
oh you're lovin I wish you would
come down here and sweepameoffmyfeet
this broom'll have to be my baby
if I hurry I just might 
get off before the dawns early light

# I Don't Wanna Grow Up

When I'm lyin' in my bed at night
I don't wanna grow up
Nothin' ever seems to turn out right
I don't wanna grow up
How do you move in a world of fog
That's always changing things
Makes me wish that I could be a dog
When I see the price that you pay
I don't wanna grow up
I don't ever wanna be that way
I don't wanna grow up

Seems like folks turn into things 
that they'd never want
The only thing to live for 
Is today...
I'm gonna put a hole in my TV set
I don't wanna grow up
Open up the medicine chest
And I don't wanna grow up
I don't wanna have to shout it out
I don't want my hair to fall out
I don't wanna be filled with doubt
I don't wanna be a good boy scout
I don't wanna have to learn to count
I don't wanna have the biggest amount
I don't wanna grow up

Well when I see my parents fight
I don't wanna grow up
They all go out and drinking all night
And I don't wanna grow up
I'd rather stay here in my room
Nothin' out there but sad and gloom
I don't wanna live in a big old tomb 
On Grand Street

When I see the 5 o'clock news
I don't wanna grow up
Comb their hair and shine their shoes
I don't wanna grow up
Stay around in my old hometown
I don't wanna put no money down
I don't wanna get me a big old loan
Work them fingers to the bone
I don't wanna float a broom
Fall in love and get married then boom
How the hell did it get here so soon
I don't wanna grow up

# I Hope That I Don't Fall In Love With You

Well, I hope that I don't fall in love with you
Cause falling in love just makes me blue
Well, the music plays and you display your heart for me to see
I had a beer and now I hear you calling out for me
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you

Well, the room is crowded, people everywhere
And I wonder, should I offer you a chair?
Well, if you sit down with this old clown, take that frown and break it
Before the evening's gone away, I think that we can make it
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you

Well, the night does funny things inside a man
These old tomcat feelings you don't understand
Well, I turn around to look at you, you light a cigarette
I wish I had the guts to bum one, but we've never met
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you

I can see that you are lonesome just like me
And it being late, you'd like some company
Well, I turn around to look at you, and you look back at me
The guy you're with he's up and split, the chair next to you is free
And I hope that you don't fall in love with me

Now it's closing time, the music's fading out
Last call for drinks, I'll have another stout
Well, I turn around to look at you, you're nowhere to be found
I search the place for your lost face, guess I'll have another round
And I think that I just fell in love with you

# I Never Talk to Strangers

Stop me if you've heard this one
But I feel as though we've met before
Perhaps I am mistaken
But it's just that I remind you of
Someone you used to care about
Oh but that was long ago
Now tell me do you really think I'd fall for that old line
I was not born just yesterday
Besides I never talk to strangers anyway

Hell I ain't a bad guy when you get to know me
I just thought there ain't no harm
Hey yeah just try minding your own business bud
Who asked you to annoy me
With your sad sad repartee
Besides I never talk to strangers anyway

Your life's a dime store novel
This town is full of guys like you
And you're looking for someone to take the place of her
You must be reading my mail
And you're bitter cause he left you
That's why you're drinking in this bar
Well only suckers fall in love with perfect strangers

It always takes one to know one stranger
Maybe we're just wiser now
Yeah and been around that block so many times
That we don't notice
That we're all just perfect strangers
As long as we ignore
That we all begin as strangers
Just before we find
We really aren't strangers anymore

# I Wish I Was In New Orleans

Well, I wish I was in New Orleans
I can see it in my dreams
arm in arm down Burgundy
a bottle and my friends and me
hoist up a few tall cool ones
play some pool and listen to that 
tenor saxophone calling me home
and I can hear the band begin
When The Saints Go Marching In
by the whiskers on my chin
New Orleans I'll be there

I'll drink you under the table
be red nose go for walks
the old haunts what I wants
is red beans and rice
and wear the dress I like so well
meet me at the old saloon
make sure there's a Dixie moon
New Orleans I'll be there

and deal the cards roll the dice
if it ain't that ole Chuck E. Weiss
and Clayborn Avenue me and you
Sam Jones and all
and I wish I was in New Orleans
I can see it in my dreams
arm in arm down Burgundy
a bottle and my friends and me
New Orleans, I'll be there

# I'll Be Gone

Tonight I'll shave the mountain
I'll cut the hearts from pharaohs
I pull the road off of the rise
tear the memories from my eyes
and in the morning I'll be gone
I drink 1000 shipwrecks
tonight I'll steal your paychecks
I paint the sheets across my bed
the birds will all fly from my head
and in the morning I'll be gone
take every dream that's breathing
find every boot that's leaving
shoot all the lights in the cafe
and in the morning I'll be gone
I bet 1000 dollars
I have a French companion
I tie myself below the deck
I pull the rope around my neck
and in the morning I'll be gone
it takes a life to win her
there is a drum of bourbon
800 pounds of nitro
his boots are thunder as he plays
there is a stone inside it
tonight his bones will ride it
I'll need a tent to hide it
and in the morning I'll be gone
and in the morning I'll be gone
and in the morning I'll be gone

# I'll Shoot The Moon

I'll shoot the moon 
Right out of the sky
For you baby
I'll be the pennies 
On your eyes
For you baby
I want to take you 
Out to the fair
Here's a red rose 
Ribbon for your hair
I'll shoot the moon 
Right out of the sky
For you baby
I'll shoot the moon 
For you
A vulture circles 
Over your head
For you baby
I'll be the flowers 
After you're dead
For you baby
I want to build 
A nest in your hair
I want to kiss you 
And never be there
I'll shoot the moon 
Right out of the sky
For you baby
I'll shoot the moon 
For you

You know I love you, baby
So why don't you call me?
You know my number
392-7704
Call any time

I'll shoot the moon right out of the sky
For you baby
I'll shoot the moon for you

I'll shoot the moon right out of the sky
For you baby
I'll be the flowers after you're dead
For you baby
I want to build a nest in your hair
I want to kiss you and never be there
I'll shoot the moon right out of the sky
For you baby
I'll shoot the moon for you
